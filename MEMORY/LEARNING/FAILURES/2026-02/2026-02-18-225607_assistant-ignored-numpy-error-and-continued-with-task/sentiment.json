  "summary": "Mild frustration that fix didn't work",
  "detailed_context": "Tony asked Ekko to fix an icon display issue in Chrome's toolbar. Ekko diagnosed the problem (12% padding making the logo tiny), explained the solution clearly, cropped the image, and attempted to rebuild it to match LastPass's visual weight. However, Tony reports seeing no visual change on his end after the fix was applied. This suggests either: (1) the rebuild didn't actually deploy/reflect in Tony's browser, (2) the cache wasn't cleared, or (3) the fix was incomplete. Tony's frustration stems from Ekko doing the diagnostic work correctly but failing in execution—the image still appears unchanged despite the explanation and effort. Ekko should have: provided cache-busting instructions, verified the deployment succeeded, offered browser refresh/hard refresh steps, or checked if the rebuilt file actually made it to the distribution folder.",
