  "summary": "Frustrated icon change didn't take effect",
  "detailed_context": "Tony was trying to fix a toolbar icon display issue where the logo appeared too small in Chrome's 16x16 toolbar slot. Ekko provided a detailed solution: identified that the source image had ~12% dark padding on all sides, cropped it so the circle fills the canvas, and stated the icon should now match LastPass's visual weight. However, after implementing these changes (copying to dist and rebuilding), Tony reports seeing no change on his end. This is frustrating because Ekko's explanation was thorough and the technical approach was sound, but the expected result didn't materialize. The root cause of Tony's frustration is the disconnect between Ekko's confident assertion that the rebuild would work and the actual lack of visible change. Ekko should have either: (1) verified the changes actually propagated in the browser (cleared cache, hard refresh), (2) confirmed the dist files were properly updated, or (3) checked if Chrome requires extension reload. This reveals Tony expects not just solutions, but verified outcomes.",
