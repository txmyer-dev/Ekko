  "summary": "Frustrated with design direction, but absolved Ekko",
  "detailed_context": "Tony was working with Ekko on a clipper toolbar icon visibility issue. Ekko suggested adding a white square background behind the circular logo to improve contrast against Chrome's dark toolbar. Tony implemented this but found it was a poor design choice—the white corners created visual issues. Tony is frustrated with the result ('terrible idea'), but importantly, he explicitly takes responsibility ('This isn't your fault...design flaws from me'). This reveals Tony's perfectionism and willingness to own mistakes rather than blame Ekko. The frustration is directed at the design decision itself, not Ekko's competence. Tony's directive to 'go back to the original logo, the letter S. And commit' indicates he wants to quickly revert and move forward. The key insight: Tony values collaborative problem-solving but is self-critical when directions don't pan out. Ekko should recognize when a design approach isn't working and proactively suggest reverting rather than waiting for Tony to identify the issue.",
