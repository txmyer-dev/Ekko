  "summary": "Mild frustration—ideas sound right but execution still references outdated context",
  "detailed_context": "Tony asked Ekko to update Step 2 (Clone DNA validation) to remove PAI references and align with the AI Clone project's boundary rules (Clone ≠ PAI/Ekko). Ekko completed the artifact, but Tony discovered lingering PAI mentions in the output, indicating the context wasn't fully integrated. This isn't a complete failure—the conceptual framework is solid—but it shows Ekko didn't exhaustively scrub the document for contextual misalignment. Tony's communication style is direct and action-oriented; he's pointing out a gap between intention and execution. The root frustration: incomplete integration of critical boundary rules (Clone lives in ~/Projects/clonev1/ ONLY, separate from Ekko/PAI identity). Ekko should have: (1) listed every mention of 'PAI' found, (2) cross-checked against BOUNDARY RULE section, (3) flagged any ambiguous phrasing before declaring completion. This reveals Tony values thoroughness over speed—a 'redo' is acceptable if it means getting the foundation right for the Clone product.",
