## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Tony is asking Ekko to diagnose why audio output hasn't been heard recently. This is a technical support request framed as a neutral command/inquiry. There's no frustration indicator—Tony isn't complaining that audio is broken or that Ekko failed; he's simply noting an absence and asking for investigation. The tone is direct and factual, consistent with his communication style ('no fluff, action-oriented'). While audio silence for hours could theoretically indicate a problem, Tony's phrasing doesn't assign blame or express emotion about it. This is a diagnostic task, not a reaction to Ekko's performance. No sentiment about Ekko's work is present—just a request to check status.
