Done. Here's the summary of everything completed this session:

---

**Quick Wins (all 5 complete):**
1. Frontmatter on all 26 Knowledge files
2. 3 templates in `Templates/`
3. Heartbeat email auth fixed (quote stripping + IMAP default)
4. ntfy inbox cleaned + archived
5. Wiki-links between all related Knowledge files

**Connective Tissue at Write-Time (your feedback, done):**
- **`~/SecondBrain/Tools/obsidian_write.py`** — Helper script that generates frontmatter and scans existing Knowledge files to auto-generate wiki-links. Uses tag overlap (+3), domain match (+2), and title keyword overlap (+1) scoring. Works as CLI (`--frontmatter-only`, `--related-only`) or importable.
- **2 new steering rules** in `USER/AISTEERINGRULES.md`:
  - *Generate Connective Tissue When Writing to SecondBrain* — mandates frontmatter + Related section on every write
  - *Obsidian Frontmatter Schema* — locks in the field names and allowed values so everything stays consistent

From now on, every file I write to SecondBrain will come pre-wired with frontmatter and wiki-links. No more orphan files, no more retrofitting passes.
