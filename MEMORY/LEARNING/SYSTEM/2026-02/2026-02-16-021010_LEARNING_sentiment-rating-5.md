# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Technical instruction, no emotional content detected

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Tony is providing a corrected voice ID (rWyjfFeMZ6PxkHqD3wGC) and requesting updates to configuration files (settings.json and KAI.md). The message is procedural and factual with no emotional indicators. However, this follows immediately after the system deleted a file, which could indicate either: (1) Tony is satisfied with the deletion and moving forward, or (2) Tony is deliberately ignoring the deletion to focus on the voice ID task. The tone is neutral and businesslike, suggesting task-focused communication rather than emotional reaction.
