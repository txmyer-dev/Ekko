## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Tony shared a curated guide to Fabric patterns organized by use case (education, content processing, business, development, thinking tools). This is purely informational—Tony is presenting a resource he's evaluated and wants to catalog/reference. No requests for Ekko to perform work, no feedback on Ekko's previous output, no frustration or satisfaction directed at Ekko's performance. The message shows Tony's systematic thinking (tiered organization, recommended workflow) and his strategic alignment (patterns directly mapped to education business goals: seniors, curriculum, automation). This is a knowledge-building/documentation action, not an emotional response to Ekko's work. No sentiment toward Ekko is present—just information transfer.
