## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

This is an automated task completion report from the PAI orchestration system documenting a comprehensive hooks audit comparing Ekko (Claude) and Daemos (Gemini) architectures. It contains technical findings about portability, event mapping, and implementation recommendations. No emotional content directed at Ekko's work is present. This is system telemetry, not Tony feedback.

## Assistant Response Context

All three research agents are running in parallel — skills audit, hooks audit, and Gemini CLI capabilities research. They're chewing through the full inventory. I'll compile everything once they report back.
