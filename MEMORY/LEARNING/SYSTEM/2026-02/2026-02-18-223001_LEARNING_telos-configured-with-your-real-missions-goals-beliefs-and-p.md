**To answer your question directly:** Yes — Daemos has full access. The data lives at `~/PAI/identity/telos/` which Daemos can read directly. Ekko reads it via the symlink at `~/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/TELOS/`. Both DAs see the same files. When you ask Daemos about your goals, he'll read the same GOALS.md you just populated.
