# Implicit Low Rating Captured: 2/10

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Rating:** 2/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Feedback:** Frustrated after 9 failed import attempts

## Context

Tony was trying to import a Web Clipper template JSON that Ekko had provided. After 9 consecutive failed import attempts, Tony is clearly frustrated and seeking help to diagnose why the import keeps failing. The root cause appears to be either: (1) the JSON schema Ekko provided doesn't match v1.0 of the Obsidian Web Clipper extension, (2) formatting issues in the JSON structure, or (3) incompatibility between the template format and the specific version Tony is running. Tony's frustration is justified—repeated failures without progress indicate Ekko's previous assistance didn't solve the actual problem. Tony is now providing debugging context (GitHub link, version number) to help Ekko identify the issue. What Ekko should have done: validated the JSON against the actual Web Clipper v1.0 documentation before providing it, tested the import process, or asked about Tony's version upfront. This reveals Tony expects solutions to actually work on first attempt, and when they don't, clear diagnostic help is needed immediately.
