# Implicit Low Rating Captured: 4/10

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Rating:** 4/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Feedback:** Mild frustration with icon size clarity

## Context

Tony was trying to make his extension's icon visually comparable to LastPass's icon in the browser toolbar. Ekko provided a solution (resizing Daemos's logo to 16/32/48/128px PNGs and integrating it into the manifest) but the resulting icon appears too small and lacks the clarity of the LastPass reference image. The root cause of Tony's frustration is that the icon quality/size doesn't meet the visual standard he was comparing against. This reveals Tony expects solutions that match industry-standard clarity and prominence in the UI. Ekko should have either: (1) suggested larger base dimensions or vector scaling, (2) explained the typical icon size specifications for Chrome extensions, or (3) recommended checking if the PNG quality needs improvement or if higher resolution sources are needed. The issue isn't that the solution was wrong—it's that the output quality doesn't match Tony's visual expectations relative to established products like LastPass.
