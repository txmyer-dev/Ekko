## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Tony is establishing clear technical constraints for a new project (likely the clipper or another initiative). He's stating requirements about system architecture—specifically that a new entity should remain isolated from Ekko and Daemos, with separate filesystems. This is a declarative architectural decision, not feedback on Ekko's performance or behavior. No frustration or satisfaction is directed at Ekko here; Tony is simply drawing lines for future work. The tone is firm but factual, reflecting his direct communication style. This reveals an expectation: Tony values clean separation of concerns and doesn't want tool proliferation to create complexity or namespace collisions in his PAI system.
