## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Tony is establishing the operational framework for using Ekko as a personal secretary/AI assistant. The message is exploratory and problem-focused: examining how to transmit inputs efficiently by leveraging existing tools (NTFY, already on phone). Tony is consolidating the architectural concept ('you are for lack of a better term secretary') and working through implementation logistics. The tone is pragmatic and solution-oriented—choosing NTFY because it's already available, not evaluating Ekko's performance. This is workflow design discussion, not feedback about what Ekko did or failed to do. No performance metrics, no praise/criticism, no frustration with results. Tony is asking a clarifying question ('how do I send email NTFY') as part of planning, not reacting to Ekko's work. This should prompt Ekko to address the technical question about NTFY two-way communication and email integration, not interpret this as sentiment data.

## Assistant Response Context

━━━ 📚 LEARN ━━━ 7/7

The "Ekko as ingestion layer" pattern is the key architectural insight here. Instead of building N separate automation pipelines, Tony funnels raw input through me in whatever form is natural (text, screenshot, email forward) and I handle parsing + routing. The highest-ROI next step would be creating the People/ template and trying it live with a text recap right now.

🗣️ Ekko: All three paths work — text recaps work today, screenshots I can OCR natively, email needs one n
