## SUMMARY

Cole Medin demonstrates how to build a personal AI assistant inspired by OpenClaw without its critical security vulnerabilities. OpenClaw reached 185,000 GitHub stars but suffers from one-click remote code execution flaws and a marketplace riddled with malicious packages stealing credentials. Rather than using OpenClaw directly, Cole reverse-engineered its four core components -- Memory System, Heartbeat, Channel Adapters, and Skills Registry -- and rebuilt them using approximately 1,000 lines of Python plus markdown files. His stack uses Obsidian for storage, Claude Agent SDK for the heartbeat scheduler, Slack and terminal as channel adapters, and Claude Code's native skill system. The approach proves that coding agents produce excellent results when given well-structured examples from existing codebases to reference. His philosophy centers on "progressive disclosure of context" -- there is no magic, just structured knowledge organized as markdown files that give AI the right information at the right time.

## IDEAS

- OpenClaw exploded to one hundred eighty five thousand GitHub stars making it the fastest growing project ever
- One click remote code execution vulnerability in OpenClaw lets attackers steal all stored data and keys
- Claw Hub marketplace contains hundreds of malicious packages designed specifically to steal user API credentials silently
- Security researchers successfully hijacked a running OpenClaw instance in under two hours using publicly known exploit paths
- Four core architectural components make OpenClaw genuinely magical and worth studying as design patterns for builders
- Memory system uses markdown files including soul and user files combined with SQLite for lightweight retrieval
- Heartbeat component runs as a scheduled job that proactively performs tasks like drafting emails without prompting
- Channel adapters enable users to communicate through WhatsApp Telegram Slack and Discord from one unified backend
- Skills registry allows adding entirely new capabilities to the assistant by dropping in single standalone files
- Cole rebuilt the entire OpenClaw architecture from scratch using only one thousand lines of Python and markdown
- Cloning existing repos and pointing Claude Code at them produces remarkably high quality implementations very quickly
- Obsidian provides local first markdown storage that syncs naturally with AI memory systems requiring no database overhead
- Claude Agent SDK enables reliable heartbeat scheduling that checks email calendar and task systems every thirty minutes
- Progressive disclosure of context means giving the AI exactly the right structured knowledge at the right time
- Coding agents perform exceptionally well when you give them good reference examples from existing working codebases nearby
- Anthropic subscriptions through Claude Code are both cost effective and fully compliant with their terms of service
- Wrapping AI provider APIs without authorization violates most providers terms of service creating significant ongoing legal risk
- Skills built as Claude Code native integrations eliminate the need for external registries or marketplace package managers
- Meta skills that create other skills represent a powerful recursive pattern for rapidly expanding assistant capabilities
- Brand and voice generator skills produce structured tone of voice documents that maintain consistent personality across outputs
- Hybrid search combining SQLite full text search with embeddings provides effective retrieval without heavy vector database infrastructure
- Session logs capture conversation history providing temporal context that pure semantic search alone would completely miss
- Soul files define the assistant personality and core values acting as the foundation for all behavioral decisions
- Agents files control behavioral patterns and delegation rules determining how the assistant approaches different task types
- Video creation skills using Remotion and React demonstrate that personal assistants can produce rich multimedia content
- Building your own version takes just a couple days and gives you complete control over security and data
- Documentation skills for runbooks and standard operating procedures turn tacit knowledge into reusable structured artifacts easily
- Slack serves as a natural primary adapter because most knowledge workers already live inside it every single day

## INSIGHTS

- Security vulnerabilities in popular open source tools often remain unpatched because community growth outpaces security review processes
- Progressive disclosure of context eliminates the need for magic because structured knowledge at the right time suffices
- Reverse engineering successful open source projects with AI coding agents is faster than building from first principles alone
- Personal AI assistants become genuinely useful only when they proactively act through heartbeat scheduling not just respond
- Markdown based memory systems outperform complex databases for personal assistants because humans can read and edit them
- The fastest path to a working AI assistant is cloning a good example and telling Claude to rebuild
- Skills as single files rather than complex packages dramatically reduce the attack surface compared to marketplace approaches
- Local first storage with Obsidian gives you complete data sovereignty which cloud dependent alternatives can never guarantee
- Cost effective AI usage comes from subscription models not from wrapping provider APIs in unauthorized third party layers
- Recursive meta skills that generate other skills create exponential capability growth from a single initial investment

## QUOTES

- "There's no magic, just structured knowledge"
- "Progressive disclosure of context"
- "You can build it in just a couple days like me"
- "~1,000 Lines of Python + Markdown"
- "Look at how they built X, build it for me"
- "Coding agents work really well when you give them good examples from existing codebases"
- "A collection of Claude Skills to turn Claude Code into a Second Brain"
- "One-click RCE vulnerability allows attackers to steal all data and API keys"
- "Researcher hijacked an OpenClaw instance in under 2 hours"
- "Claw Hub marketplace has hundreds of malicious packages stealing credentials"

## HABITS

- Clone existing well architected repositories before starting new projects to give your coding agent strong reference material
- Run heartbeat checks every thirty minutes to proactively surface emails calendar events and pending task items regularly
- Store all memory and context as plain markdown files that both humans and AI can easily read
- Adopt Obsidian as your primary storage layer to maintain local ownership of all your personal knowledge data
- Build skills as single self contained files rather than complex multi file packages to keep things maintainable
- Point Claude Code directly at reference implementations and say look at how they built this feature
- Keep your AI assistant architecture under one thousand lines of code so you can understand every piece
- Leverage Slack as your primary channel adapter since it integrates naturally with your existing daily work flow
- Create a meta skill that generates other skills so your assistant capabilities can grow recursively over time
- Review OpenClaw architectural patterns as design references without actually running their potentially vulnerable code in production
- Maintain a soul file that defines your assistant personality values and behavioral boundaries in plain readable markdown
- Preserve session logs alongside semantic memory to retain temporal context that embedding search alone would miss entirely
- Pair SQLite locally and Postgres remotely to keep your data portable without vendor lock in to cloud
- Tailor channel adapters for the platforms you already use daily rather than trying to support every possible option
- Check Claw Hub packages carefully for malicious code before installing because hundreds contain credential stealing payloads hidden
- Separate your memory system into distinct files for personality preferences core memories and behavioral rules for clarity
- Test your heartbeat scheduler with low frequency intervals first then increase as you verify reliable consistent execution
- Implement progressive disclosure patterns to feed AI context incrementally rather than dumping everything into one massive prompt
- Deploy brand and voice documents early so every output from your assistant maintains a consistent recognizable tone
- Validate that your AI tool usage complies with provider terms of service before scaling up to avoid bans
