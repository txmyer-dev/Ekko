- **Ghost CMS on Coolify** — You mentioned discovering Ghost CMS today via a podcast. It's a one-click Coolify install that handles blogging, newsletters, and memberships. It has native markdown support that pairs well with Obsidian workflows. If you're still evaluating options for the blog you built this weekend, this might replace the custom setup with less maintenance overhead.
