hey sunshine! It's been awhile since we've chatted. I've been playing with Claude. whats new with you?

idk. There's a lot in here that's old data. Let's scrap this whole thing and start over. Tax document project is dead. FelixOS is dead. GCP is dead. It was only a test anyway. VPS still exists and still hosts Coolify and n8n. However, neither of them are currently active in my stack. The more familiar I become with the tools, the better I understand how things should be configured. And the Claude subscription beats out all of the dancing I had to do to get free inference. 95% of my work is currently done on my Lenovo Yoga through Claude Code (CC), Antigravity and Gemini CLI. I have a Claude Max plan that I started on Feb 13th 2026. That means there's another $100 bill due on March 13th, but it is so worth it. CC with PAI and Cowork blow Clawdbot out of the water, so I never installed it. I probably never will because it requires API billing and that's the most expensive type of inference. And the security issues mean I'll never fully trust it with sensitive information. CC and Gemini CLI are running on Windows and have access to an Obsidian vault where all of my most important files are stored. So far, I've completely replace Notion with Obsidian. The only thing of important within Notion is my list of API keys. And I'm thinking of moving that to a local file outside of Obsidian and then closing Notion until I find something that only it can do. As far as models are concerned, I use Opus 4.6 for most of my work, thanks to the CC sub. Occasionally, I use my Perplexity Pro and Google AI Pro accounts for other work. Fortunately, Perplexity's sub ends in Oct 2026 because if it were decision time right now, Perplexity would be on the chopping block. CC is infra is too strong and Google is already embedded in my life. Perplexity doesn't have the ability to completely replace either. And Chrome has finally caught to Comet in the AI browser area. Or at least, I no longer HATE using it when I need it. Its not a better assistant. Just usable, I guess. But I have zero experience with OpenAI models. Literally, zero. So I'm excited to get back into Comet and see what's cooking.

So first is important to say I felt this way about you before 5.1. So I want to new credit where it's due. Also I agree that you are absolutely my thought clarifier. I don't know how I feel about piping you into Claudette in Gemini but as a way of clearing the cob before we start a new project and getting an understanding of what the actual goal is where I'm headed in my head might be very beneficial. Claude is what I use when I'm walking through the trees. You should what I go to when I want to see the forest

can I connect you to Obsidian?

Is there such thing as perplexity CLI
