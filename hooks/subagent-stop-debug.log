[2026-02-14T00:59:59.280Z] Full task output for debugging: Perfect! I've found all the statusline configuration files. Here's a comprehensive summary:

## Claude Code Statusline Configuration Files

### 1. Main Settings Reference
**File:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/settings.json` (lines 240-243)

```json
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "${PAI_DIR}/statusline-command.sh"
}
```

The statusline is configured as a command-based hook that points to a bash script.

---

### 2. Primary Statusline Implementation
**File:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/statusline-command.sh` (1187 lines)

This is the main statusline rendering engine with:

**Key Features:**
- **4 display modes** based on terminal width (nano <35, micro 35-54, mini 55-79, normal 80+)
- **7 output lines:** PAI Branding, Context usage, Token tracking, PWD/Git, Memory, Learning signals, Quotes
- **Parallel data prefetch** for expensive operations (git, location, weather, file counts, tokens)
- **Token usage tracking** (today, this month, last month)
- **Git integration** (branch, stash, modifications, sync status, commit age)
- **Learning signal analysis** with sparklines and trend calculation
- **Context bar** with gradient color scaling (green→yellow→orange→red)
- **Location/weather display** with caching

**Key Configuration Variables:**
```bash
PAI_DIR="${PAI_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"
SETTINGS_FILE="$PAI_DIR/settings.json"
RATINGS_FILE="$PAI_DIR/MEMORY/LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl"
LOCATION_CACHE_TTL=3600  # 1 hour
WEATHER_CACHE_TTL=900    # 15 minutes
GIT_CACHE_TTL=5          # 5 seconds
```

**Color Palette:**
- Uses Tailwind-inspired RGB colors (38;2;R;G;B format)
- Themes: Violet (greeting), Cyan/Teal (wielding), Sky/Blue (git), Purple (learning), Indigo (context), Gold (tokens)

**Context Scaling:**
- Reads `contextDisplay.compactionThreshold` from settings.json
- Scales percentage display: `display_pct = (raw_pct * 100) / threshold`

---

### 3. Debug Wrapper
**File:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/statusline-debug.sh` (34 lines)

Debug utility that:
- Captures incoming JSON input from Claude Code
- Saves full payloads to `/tmp/statusline-capture-{timestamp}.json`
- Logs context-related field paths for debugging
- Extracts both `.tokens.*` and `.context_window.*` paths
- Feeds captured input to the main statusline-command.sh

**Debug Output:** `/tmp/statusline-debug.log`

---

### Related Files
**File:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/VoiceServer/status.sh`

This appears to be a voice server status file (separate from Claude Code statusline).

---

## Key Insights

1. **Input Format:** Claude Code sends JSON via stdin containing:
   - `.context_window.used_percentage`
   - `.context_window.context_window_size`
   - `.context_window.total_input_tokens`
   - `.context_window.total_output_tokens`
   - `.model.display_name`
   - `.version`
   - `.workspace.current_dir`

2. **Caching Strategy:** Extensive use of TTL-based caching to minimize expensive operations (git commands, API calls)

3. **Compaction Threshold:** Settings.json can configure context display scaling via `contextDisplay.compactionThreshold` (default 100 = raw percentage)

4. **Dynamic Terminal Adaptation:** Detects terminal width via Kitty IPC → tty → tput → COLUMNS environment variable

5. **Parallel Execution:** Launches 5 background jobs simultaneously for git, location, weather, file counts, and token calculations

[2026-02-14T02:13:23.154Z] Full task output for debugging: ## Summary of Findings

Here are all the findings regarding running Claude Code programmatically on this system:

### Claude Code CLI
- **Location**: `/home/txmyer/.local/bin/claude` (symlink)
- **Target**: `/home/txmyer/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.42`
- **Binary Type**: ELF 64-bit executable
- **Available Versions**:
  - 2.1.39 (222MB)
  - 2.1.41 (223MB)
  - 2.1.42 (223MB, current active)

### CLI Capabilities
- **No batch/non-interactive mode**: The CLI has a **nested session blocker** - running `claude --help` returns: "Claude Code cannot be launched inside another Claude Code session. Nested sessions share runtime resources and will crash all active sessions."
- **Bypass available**: Can unset the `CLAUDECODE` environment variable to bypass this check
- **No explicit `--print` or `-p` flags found** in the help output (cannot access full help due to nested session constraint)

### Python SDK Status
- **anthropic SDK**: NOT installed (ModuleNotFoundError)
- **claude-code-sdk**: NOT found in pip list
- **No Python packages named "claude"** found in pip list

### Cron Availability
- **Status**: Could not verify due to nested session constraints
- **Likely**: Cron is available (WSL2 on Windows typically has cron), but cannot confirm crontab -l output

### Systemd User Timers
- **Status**: Could not verify due to nested session constraints
- **Typical for WSL2**: May not be fully enabled or available

### Recommendations for Programmatic Use
1. **Use `unset CLAUDECODE` + claude CLI** - This is the available method to run Claude Code from within a script
2. **Install anthropic SDK** - Run `pip3 install anthropic` to use Python SDK directly (recommended)
3. **Cron scheduling** - After unsetting CLAUDECODE, cron commands should work to schedule claude tasks
4. **Alternative**: Write scripts using the anthropic Python SDK once installed, then schedule with cron or systemd timers

[2026-02-14T03:14:39.740Z] Full task output for debugging: ## Summary of Findings

Here are all the findings regarding running Claude Code programmatically on this system:

### Claude Code CLI
- **Location**: `/home/txmyer/.local/bin/claude` (symlink)
- **Target**: `/home/txmyer/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.42`
- **Binary Type**: ELF 64-bit executable
- **Available Versions**:
  - 2.1.39 (222MB)
  - 2.1.41 (223MB)
  - 2.1.42 (223MB, current active)

### CLI Capabilities
- **No batch/non-interactive mode**: The CLI has a **nested session blocker** - running `claude --help` returns: "Claude Code cannot be launched inside another Claude Code session. Nested sessions share runtime resources and will crash all active sessions."
- **Bypass available**: Can unset the `CLAUDECODE` environment variable to bypass this check
- **No explicit `--print` or `-p` flags found** in the help output (cannot access full help due to nested session constraint)

### Python SDK Status
- **anthropic SDK**: NOT installed (ModuleNotFoundError)
- **claude-code-sdk**: NOT found in pip list
- **No Python packages named "claude"** found in pip list

### Cron Availability
- **Status**: Could not verify due to nested session constraints
- **Likely**: Cron is available (WSL2 on Windows typically has cron), but cannot confirm crontab -l output

### Systemd User Timers
- **Status**: Could not verify due to nested session constraints
- **Typical for WSL2**: May not be fully enabled or available

### Recommendations for Programmatic Use
1. **Use `unset CLAUDECODE` + claude CLI** - This is the available method to run Claude Code from within a script
2. **Install anthropic SDK** - Run `pip3 install anthropic` to use Python SDK directly (recommended)
3. **Cron scheduling** - After unsetting CLAUDECODE, cron commands should work to schedule claude tasks
4. **Alternative**: Write scripts using the anthropic Python SDK once installed, then schedule with cron or systemd timers

## Research Report: Public APIs for PAI System

### Query Analysis

I decomposed this into 7 category searches across the full public-apis repository (1,891 lines, 47+ categories), then verified free tier availability and current status through supplementary web research on the most promising APIs.

### Findings by Category

**1. HEARTBEAT ENRICHMENT** -- The highest-impact, lowest-effort wins:

- **Open-Meteo** (no auth, CORS, free) is the clear winner for weather. Zero signup, hit it with Philly coordinates, get 7-16 day forecasts. Pair with **US Weather / NWS** for severe weather alerts (also no auth).
- **HackerNews API** and **Inshorts News** both require zero authentication -- instant integration for tech news in the heartbeat.
- **GNews** (100 req/day free) is the best authenticated news option with topic filtering.
- **Alpha Vantage** (500 calls/day) or **Finnhub** (60/min) for stock data. Finnhub has better rate limits.
- **Stoicism Quote API** and **Quotable** -- no auth, perfectly aligned with "Discipline Equals Freedom."

**2. BUSINESS TOOLS** -- For the consulting business:

- **SendGrid** (100 emails/day free forever) for transactional email, **Sendinblue/Brevo** (300/day) for marketing.
- **Hunter** and **Tomba** for B2B email finding and lead generation.
- **Domainsdb.info** (no auth) for prospect research.

**3. AUTOMATION / INTEGRATION** -- The glue layer:

- **ntfy.sh** is the standout. No auth for public topics, self-hostable on your VPS, dead simple HTTP POST to send notifications. This should be the notification backbone.
- **Telegram Bot API** for rich notifications with formatting and buttons.
- **RSS to JSON** (no auth) converts any RSS feed to structured data for n8n processing.

**4. SECURITY / OSINT** -- Double duty as consulting deliverables:

- **AbuseIPDB** (1,000 checks/day free) for monitoring IPs hitting your VPS.
- **Shodan** for internet device scanning and client security audits.
- **HaveIBeenPwned Passwords API** is free with no key needed (k-Anonymity model). Note: email search requires paid subscription.
- **URLhaus** (no auth) and **PhishStats** (no auth) for malware/phishing monitoring.
- **National Vulnerability Database** (no auth) for CVE monitoring on your stack.

**5. CONTENT / KNOWLEDGE** -- Feed the second brain:

- **Open Library** and **Gutendex** (both no auth) for book discovery and reading lists.
- **Crossref Metadata** (no auth) for academic research discovery.
- **WolframAlpha** (2,000 free calls/month) for computational queries.

**6. AI / ML** -- Supplementary capabilities:

- **OpenVisionAPI** (no auth) for computer vision without paid API.
- **LibreTranslate** (no auth, self-hostable) for translation.
- **NLP Cloud** for sentiment analysis and text summarization.

**7. DEVELOPMENT** -- Infrastructure monitoring:

- **Uptime Kuma** -- deploy on VPS via Coolify, monitor everything, 78+ notification integrations. Free forever.
- **IPify** (no auth) for VPS health checks.
- **NetworkCalc** (no auth) for DNS and subnet diagnostics.

### Strategic Insights

Three moves ahead, here is what matters:

1. **Phase 1 costs nothing.** Six no-auth APIs (Open-Meteo, NWS, Quotable, HackerNews, ntfy, IPify) can be integrated this week with zero signup, zero cost, zero rate limit concerns. The heartbeat goes from 3 data sources to 9.

2. **The security APIs are a consulting product.** Shodan + AbuseIPDB + GreyNoise + SecurityTrails + NVD = "AI-Powered Security Audit" as a paid service offering. You are building the product while you build the infrastructure.

3. **n8n is the multiplier.** Every single API listed above works with n8n's HTTP Request node. Deploy n8n on Coolify, and these APIs become automated pipelines rather than manual lookups.

4. **Fallback chains prevent single points of failure.** Always have 2 sources for critical heartbeat data: Open-Meteo primary, OpenWeatherMap backup. GNews primary, Currents backup.

5. **Rate limit awareness is essential.** With 10+ APIs, build a simple call counter (Redis or JSON file) to avoid accidentally burning through free tiers.

## Research Report: Public APIs for PAI System

### Query Analysis

I decomposed this into 7 category searches across the full public-apis repository (1,891 lines, 47+ categories), then verified free tier availability and current status through supplementary web research on the most promising APIs.

### Findings by Category

**1. HEARTBEAT ENRICHMENT** -- The highest-impact, lowest-effort wins:

- **Open-Meteo** (no auth, CORS, free) is the clear winner for weather. Zero signup, hit it with Philly coordinates, get 7-16 day forecasts. Pair with **US Weather / NWS** for severe weather alerts (also no auth).
- **HackerNews API** and **Inshorts News** both require zero authentication -- instant integration for tech news in the heartbeat.
- **GNews** (100 req/day free) is the best authenticated news option with topic filtering.
- **Alpha Vantage** (500 calls/day) or **Finnhub** (60/min) for stock data. Finnhub has better rate limits.
- **Stoicism Quote API** and **Quotable** -- no auth, perfectly aligned with "Discipline Equals Freedom."

**2. BUSINESS TOOLS** -- For the consulting business:

- **SendGrid** (100 emails/day free forever) for transactional email, **Sendinblue/Brevo** (300/day) for marketing.
- **Hunter** and **Tomba** for B2B email finding and lead generation.
- **Domainsdb.info** (no auth) for prospect research.

**3. AUTOMATION / INTEGRATION** -- The glue layer:

- **ntfy.sh** is the standout. No auth for public topics, self-hostable on your VPS, dead simple HTTP POST to send notifications. This should be the notification backbone.
- **Telegram Bot API** for rich notifications with formatting and buttons.
- **RSS to JSON** (no auth) converts any RSS feed to structured data for n8n processing.

**4. SECURITY / OSINT** -- Double duty as consulting deliverables:

- **AbuseIPDB** (1,000 checks/day free) for monitoring IPs hitting your VPS.
- **Shodan** for internet device scanning and client security audits.
- **HaveIBeenPwned Passwords API** is free with no key needed (k-Anonymity model). Note: email search requires paid subscription.
- **URLhaus** (no auth) and **PhishStats** (no auth) for malware/phishing monitoring.
- **National Vulnerability Database** (no auth) for CVE monitoring on your stack.

**5. CONTENT / KNOWLEDGE** -- Feed the second brain:

- **Open Library** and **Gutendex** (both no auth) for book discovery and reading lists.
- **Crossref Metadata** (no auth) for academic research discovery.
- **WolframAlpha** (2,000 free calls/month) for computational queries.

**6. AI / ML** -- Supplementary capabilities:

- **OpenVisionAPI** (no auth) for computer vision without paid API.
- **LibreTranslate** (no auth, self-hostable) for translation.
- **NLP Cloud** for sentiment analysis and text summarization.

**7. DEVELOPMENT** -- Infrastructure monitoring:

- **Uptime Kuma** -- deploy on VPS via Coolify, monitor everything, 78+ notification integrations. Free forever.
- **IPify** (no auth) for VPS health checks.
- **NetworkCalc** (no auth) for DNS and subnet diagnostics.

### Strategic Insights

Three moves ahead, here is what matters:

1. **Phase 1 costs nothing.** Six no-auth APIs (Open-Meteo, NWS, Quotable, HackerNews, ntfy, IPify) can be integrated this week with zero signup, zero cost, zero rate limit concerns. The heartbeat goes from 3 data sources to 9.

2. **The security APIs are a consulting product.** Shodan + AbuseIPDB + GreyNoise + SecurityTrails + NVD = "AI-Powered Security Audit" as a paid service offering. You are building the product while you build the infrastructure.

3. **n8n is the multiplier.** Every single API listed above works with n8n's HTTP Request node. Deploy n8n on Coolify, and these APIs become automated pipelines rather than manual lookups.

4. **Fallback chains prevent single points of failure.** Always have 2 sources for critical heartbeat data: Open-Meteo primary, OpenWeatherMap backup. GNews primary, Currents backup.

5. **Rate limit awareness is essential.** With 10+ APIs, build a simple call counter (Redis or JSON file) to avoid accidentally burning through free tiers.

[2026-02-14T13:39:01.655Z] Full task output for debugging: Here is a comprehensive breakdown covering all seven of your questions.

---

## 1. Does n8n Have a Native OpenRouter Node?

**Yes.** As of n8n version 1.78 (released around late 2024), there is a built-in **OpenRouter Chat Model** node. It is a first-class sub-node in n8n's LangChain integration, meaning it sits alongside OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic Chat Model, etc. in the node palette.

Before v1.78, there was no native support -- you had to use the OpenAI Chat Model node with a custom base URL as a workaround. A third-party community node also exists on GitHub ([n8n-nodes-openrouter by MatthewSabia1](https://github.com/MatthewSabia1/n8n-nodes-openrouter)), but you should not need it on current versions.

**Bottom line:** If you are on n8n 1.78 or later, use the native node. If you are on an older version, the OpenAI-compatible workaround still works.

---

## 2. How Do You Connect n8n to OpenRouter?

There are two paths depending on your n8n version:

### Path A: Native OpenRouter Chat Model Node (v1.78+, recommended)

The **OpenRouter Chat Model** node plugs directly into root nodes like the **AI Agent**, **Basic LLM Chain**, or any LangChain-based node as the model sub-node. You create **OpenRouter credentials** (a dedicated credential type), select your model from a dynamically loaded dropdown, and you are done.

### Path B: OpenAI Chat Model Node with Custom Base URL (v1.77 and earlier)

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

---

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

---

## 5. Community Workflows and Templates

Several useful templates exist on n8n's template library:

1. **[Use OpenRouter in n8n versions <1.78](https://n8n.io/workflows/2897-use-openrouter-in-n8n-versions-less178/)** -- The canonical workaround template for older versions. Shows the OpenAI node + base URL override approach.

2. **[Dynamic AI Model Router for Query Optimization](https://n8n.io/workflows/4237-dynamic-ai-model-router-for-query-optimization-with-openrouter/)** -- An AI Agent analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the best model (Claude for coding, Perplexity Sonar for web search, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning). This is a strong pattern for cost optimization.

3. **[Multichannel Customer Support AI Assistant with Chatwoot](https://n8n.io/workflows/8260-build-a-multichannel-customer-support-ai-assistant-with-chatwoot-and-openrouter/)** -- Production-grade customer support template using OpenRouter as the LLM backbone.

4. **[AI-Optimized Content Posting to X, Discord & LinkedIn](https://n8n.io/workflows/4022-ai-optimized-content-posting-to-x-discord-and-linkedin-with-openrouter/)** -- Uses OpenRouter to optimize content per platform.

5. **[Community Questions Monitor with Reddit & Forum Scraping](https://n8n.io/workflows/6592-community-questions-monitor-with-openrouter-ai-reddit-and-forum-scraping/)** -- Scrapes forums, summarizes with OpenRouter AI, sends email reports.

6. **[Chat with AI Models via OpenRouter using Mistral](https://n8n.io/workflows/5998-chat-with-ai-models-via-openrouter-using-mistral/)** -- Demonstrates manual trigger + model config + API request pattern.

---

## 6. Common Gotchas and Issues

From multiple community threads and GitHub issues, here are the real problems people hit:

| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Models not showing in dropdown** | After adding credentials, the model list stays empty or loads intermittently | Verify API key is valid. Try refreshing the page. Check n8n version is 1.78+. Known bug ([GitHub #15592](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/15592), [#12571](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/12571)). |
| **Free model rate limiting** | Workflow errors with "Rate limit reached" and no automatic fallback | Use Error Trigger node to catch and route to paid model. Do not rely on built-in fallback. |
| **Credential validation warning** | When using OpenAI credentials with OpenRouter base URL, n8n shows a connection warning | This is expected. The validation test hits OpenAI's endpoint, not OpenRouter. Ignore it and save anyway. |
| **"Cannot read properties of undefined"** | Cryptic error when calling models | Usually means you need credits on your OpenRouter account, even for free models. Add credits. |
| **No embedding support** | OpenRouter does not serve embedding models | You must use a separate provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for embeddings. OpenRouter is chat models only. |
| **Model string must be exact** | When using the OpenAI workaround, the dropdown does not work | Switch to Expression mode and type the exact model ID from OpenRouter docs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). |
| **Streaming not available via HTTP Request** | If you use the HTTP Request node instead of the native node, you lose streaming | Use the native OpenRouter Chat Model node or accept non-streaming responses. |
| **Version-specific credential bugs** | v1.74.1 had a known credential regression for OpenRouter | Update to latest stable n8n. The issue was fixed in subsequent releases. |

---

## 7. OpenRouter vs Claude API vs OpenAI API Directly in n8n

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

---

## Summary

n8n has solid native OpenRouter support since v1.78. The setup is straightforward -- create credentials with your API key, pick the OpenRouter Chat Model node, select a model from the dropdown, and connect it to your AI Agent. The main things to watch out for are the embedding limitation, free model rate limits, and the occasional model-list-not-loading bug. For your use case as someone already running n8n, the native node is the way to go, and the dynamic model router template is worth looking at for cost optimization.

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

## 5. Community Workflows and Templates

Several useful templates exist on n8n's template library:

1. **[Use OpenRouter in n8n versions <1.78](https://n8n.io/workflows/2897-use-openrouter-in-n8n-versions-less178/)** -- The canonical workaround template for older versions. Shows the OpenAI node + base URL override approach.

2. **[Dynamic AI Model Router for Query Optimization](https://n8n.io/workflows/4237-dynamic-ai-model-router-for-query-optimization-with-openrouter/)** -- An AI Agent analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the best model (Claude for coding, Perplexity Sonar for web search, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning). This is a strong pattern for cost optimization.

3. **[Multichannel Customer Support AI Assistant with Chatwoot](https://n8n.io/workflows/8260-build-a-multichannel-customer-support-ai-assistant-with-chatwoot-and-openrouter/)** -- Production-grade customer support template using OpenRouter as the LLM backbone.

4. **[AI-Optimized Content Posting to X, Discord & LinkedIn](https://n8n.io/workflows/4022-ai-optimized-content-posting-to-x-discord-and-linkedin-with-openrouter/)** -- Uses OpenRouter to optimize content per platform.

5. **[Community Questions Monitor with Reddit & Forum Scraping](https://n8n.io/workflows/6592-community-questions-monitor-with-openrouter-ai-reddit-and-forum-scraping/)** -- Scrapes forums, summarizes with OpenRouter AI, sends email reports.

6. **[Chat with AI Models via OpenRouter using Mistral](https://n8n.io/workflows/5998-chat-with-ai-models-via-openrouter-using-mistral/)** -- Demonstrates manual trigger + model config + API request pattern.

## 6. Common Gotchas and Issues

From multiple community threads and GitHub issues, here are the real problems people hit:

| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Models not showing in dropdown** | After adding credentials, the model list stays empty or loads intermittently | Verify API key is valid. Try refreshing the page. Check n8n version is 1.78+. Known bug ([GitHub #15592](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/15592), [#12571](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/12571)). |
| **Free model rate limiting** | Workflow errors with "Rate limit reached" and no automatic fallback | Use Error Trigger node to catch and route to paid model. Do not rely on built-in fallback. |
| **Credential validation warning** | When using OpenAI credentials with OpenRouter base URL, n8n shows a connection warning | This is expected. The validation test hits OpenAI's endpoint, not OpenRouter. Ignore it and save anyway. |
| **"Cannot read properties of undefined"** | Cryptic error when calling models | Usually means you need credits on your OpenRouter account, even for free models. Add credits. |
| **No embedding support** | OpenRouter does not serve embedding models | You must use a separate provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for embeddings. OpenRouter is chat models only. |
| **Model string must be exact** | When using the OpenAI workaround, the dropdown does not work | Switch to Expression mode and type the exact model ID from OpenRouter docs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). |
| **Streaming not available via HTTP Request** | If you use the HTTP Request node instead of the native node, you lose streaming | Use the native OpenRouter Chat Model node or accept non-streaming responses. |
| **Version-specific credential bugs** | v1.74.1 had a known credential regression for OpenRouter | Update to latest stable n8n. The issue was fixed in subsequent releases. |

---

## 7. OpenRouter vs Claude API vs OpenAI API Directly in n8n

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

---

## Summary

n8n has solid native OpenRouter support since v1.78. The setup is straightforward -- create credentials with your API key, pick the OpenRouter Chat Model node, select a model from the dropdown, and connect it to your AI Agent. The main things to watch out for are the embedding limitation, free model rate limits, and the occasional model-list-not-loading bug. For your use case as someone already running n8n, the native node is the way to go, and the dynamic model router template is worth looking at for cost optimization.

[2026-02-14T13:43:53.254Z] Full task output for debugging: Here is a comprehensive breakdown covering all seven of your questions.

---

## 1. Does n8n Have a Native OpenRouter Node?

**Yes.** As of n8n version 1.78 (released around late 2024), there is a built-in **OpenRouter Chat Model** node. It is a first-class sub-node in n8n's LangChain integration, meaning it sits alongside OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic Chat Model, etc. in the node palette.

Before v1.78, there was no native support -- you had to use the OpenAI Chat Model node with a custom base URL as a workaround. A third-party community node also exists on GitHub ([n8n-nodes-openrouter by MatthewSabia1](https://github.com/MatthewSabia1/n8n-nodes-openrouter)), but you should not need it on current versions.

**Bottom line:** If you are on n8n 1.78 or later, use the native node. If you are on an older version, the OpenAI-compatible workaround still works.

---

## 2. How Do You Connect n8n to OpenRouter?

There are two paths depending on your n8n version:

### Path A: Native OpenRouter Chat Model Node (v1.78+, recommended)

The **OpenRouter Chat Model** node plugs directly into root nodes like the **AI Agent**, **Basic LLM Chain**, or any LangChain-based node as the model sub-node. You create **OpenRouter credentials** (a dedicated credential type), select your model from a dynamically loaded dropdown, and you are done.

### Path B: OpenAI Chat Model Node with Custom Base URL (v1.77 and earlier)

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

---

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

## 5. Community Workflows and Templates

Several useful templates exist on n8n's template library:

1. **[Use OpenRouter in n8n versions <1.78](https://n8n.io/workflows/2897-use-openrouter-in-n8n-versions-less178/)** -- The canonical workaround template for older versions. Shows the OpenAI node + base URL override approach.

2. **[Dynamic AI Model Router for Query Optimization](https://n8n.io/workflows/4237-dynamic-ai-model-router-for-query-optimization-with-openrouter/)** -- An AI Agent analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the best model (Claude for coding, Perplexity Sonar for web search, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning). This is a strong pattern for cost optimization.

3. **[Multichannel Customer Support AI Assistant with Chatwoot](https://n8n.io/workflows/8260-build-a-multichannel-customer-support-ai-assistant-with-chatwoot-and-openrouter/)** -- Production-grade customer support template using OpenRouter as the LLM backbone.

## 6. Common Gotchas and Issues

From multiple community threads and GitHub issues, here are the real problems people hit:

| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Models not showing in dropdown** | After adding credentials, the model list stays empty or loads intermittently | Verify API key is valid. Try refreshing the page. Check n8n version is 1.78+. Known bug ([GitHub #15592](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/15592), [#12571](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/12571)). |
| **Free model rate limiting** | Workflow errors with "Rate limit reached" and no automatic fallback | Use Error Trigger node to catch and route to paid model. Do not rely on built-in fallback. |
| **Credential validation warning** | When using OpenAI credentials with OpenRouter base URL, n8n shows a connection warning | This is expected. The validation test hits OpenAI's endpoint, not OpenRouter. Ignore it and save anyway. |
| **"Cannot read properties of undefined"** | Cryptic error when calling models | Usually means you need credits on your OpenRouter account, even for free models. Add credits. |
| **No embedding support** | OpenRouter does not serve embedding models | You must use a separate provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for embeddings. OpenRouter is chat models only. |
| **Model string must be exact** | When using the OpenAI workaround, the dropdown does not work | Switch to Expression mode and type the exact model ID from OpenRouter docs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). |
| **Streaming not available via HTTP Request** | If you use the HTTP Request node instead of the native node, you lose streaming | Use the native OpenRouter Chat Model node or accept non-streaming responses. |
| **Version-specific credential bugs** | v1.74.1 had a known credential regression for OpenRouter | Update to latest stable n8n. The issue was fixed in subsequent releases. |

---

## 7. OpenRouter vs Claude API vs OpenAI API Directly in n8n

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

## Summary

n8n has solid native OpenRouter support since v1.78. The setup is straightforward -- create credentials with your API key, pick the OpenRouter Chat Model node, select a model from the dropdown, and connect it to your AI Agent. The main things to watch out for are the embedding limitation, free model rate limits, and the occasional model-list-not-loading bug. For your use case as someone already running n8n, the native node is the way to go, and the dynamic model router template is worth looking at for cost optimization.

---

## 1. Does n8n Have a Native OpenRouter Node?

**Yes.** As of n8n version 1.78 (released around late 2024), there is a built-in **OpenRouter Chat Model** node. It is a first-class sub-node in n8n's LangChain integration, meaning it sits alongside OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic Chat Model, etc. in the node palette.

Before v1.78, there was no native support -- you had to use the OpenAI Chat Model node with a custom base URL as a workaround. A third-party community node also exists on GitHub ([n8n-nodes-openrouter by MatthewSabia1](https://github.com/MatthewSabia1/n8n-nodes-openrouter)), but you should not need it on current versions.

**Bottom line:** If you are on n8n 1.78 or later, use the native node. If you are on an older version, the OpenAI-compatible workaround still works.

---

## 2. How Do You Connect n8n to OpenRouter?

There are two paths depending on your n8n version:

### Path A: Native OpenRouter Chat Model Node (v1.78+, recommended)

The **OpenRouter Chat Model** node plugs directly into root nodes like the **AI Agent**, **Basic LLM Chain**, or any LangChain-based node as the model sub-node. You create **OpenRouter credentials** (a dedicated credential type), select your model from a dynamically loaded dropdown, and you are done.

### Path B: OpenAI Chat Model Node with Custom Base URL (v1.77 and earlier)

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"

- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

[2026-02-14T14:07:52.020Z] Full task output for debugging: Here is a comprehensive breakdown covering all seven of your questions.

## 1. Does n8n Have a Native OpenRouter Node?

**Yes.** As of n8n version 1.78 (released around late 2024), there is a built-in **OpenRouter Chat Model** node. It is a first-class sub-node in n8n's LangChain integration, meaning it sits alongside OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic Chat Model, etc. in the node palette.

Before v1.78, there was no native support -- you had to use the OpenAI Chat Model node with a custom base URL as a workaround. A third-party community node also exists on GitHub ([n8n-nodes-openrouter by MatthewSabia1](https://github.com/MatthewSabia1/n8n-nodes-openrouter)), but you should not need it on current versions.

**Bottom line:** If you are on n8n 1.78 or later, use the native node. If you are on an older version, the OpenAI-compatible workaround still works.

---

## 2. How Do You Connect n8n to OpenRouter?

There are two paths depending on your n8n version:

### Path A: Native OpenRouter Chat Model Node (v1.78+, recommended)

The **OpenRouter Chat Model** node plugs directly into root nodes like the **AI Agent**, **Basic LLM Chain**, or any LangChain-based node as the model sub-node. You create **OpenRouter credentials** (a dedicated credential type), select your model from a dynamically loaded dropdown, and you are done.

### Path B: OpenAI Chat Model Node with Custom Base URL (v1.77 and earlier)

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

---

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

---

## 5. Community Workflows and Templates

Several useful templates exist on n8n's template library:

1. **[Use OpenRouter in n8n versions <1.78](https://n8n.io/workflows/2897-use-openrouter-in-n8n-versions-less178/)** -- The canonical workaround template for older versions. Shows the OpenAI node + base URL override approach.

2. **[Dynamic AI Model Router for Query Optimization](https://n8n.io/workflows/4237-dynamic-ai-model-router-for-query-optimization-with-openrouter/)** -- An AI Agent analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the best model (Claude for coding, Perplexity Sonar for web search, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning). This is a strong pattern for cost optimization.

3. **[Multichannel Customer Support AI Assistant with Chatwoot](https://n8n.io/workflows/8260-build-a-multichannel-customer-support-ai-assistant-with-chatwoot-and-openrouter/)** -- Production-grade customer support template using OpenRouter as the LLM backbone.

4. **[AI-Optimized Content Posting to X, Discord & LinkedIn](https://n8n.io/workflows/4022-ai-optimized-content-posting-to-x-discord-and-linkedin-with-openrouter/)** -- Uses OpenRouter to optimize content per platform.

5. **[Community Questions Monitor with Reddit & Forum Scraping](https://n8n.io/workflows/6592-community-questions-monitor-with-openrouter-ai-reddit-and-forum-scraping/)** -- Scrapes forums, summarizes with OpenRouter AI, sends email reports.

6. **[Chat with AI Models via OpenRouter using Mistral](https://n8n.io/workflows/5998-chat-with-ai-models-via-openrouter-using-mistral/)** -- Demonstrates manual trigger + model config + API request pattern.

---

## 6. Common Gotchas and Issues

From multiple community threads and GitHub issues, here are the real problems people hit:

| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Models not showing in dropdown** | After adding credentials, the model list stays empty or loads intermittently | Verify API key is valid. Try refreshing the page. Check n8n version is 1.78+. Known bug ([GitHub #15592](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/15592), [#12571](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/12571)). |
| **Free model rate limiting** | Workflow errors with "Rate limit reached" and no automatic fallback | Use Error Trigger node to catch and route to paid model. Do not rely on built-in fallback. |
| **Credential validation warning** | When using OpenAI credentials with OpenRouter base URL, n8n shows a connection warning | This is expected. The validation test hits OpenAI's endpoint, not OpenRouter. Ignore it and save anyway. |
| **"Cannot read properties of undefined"** | Cryptic error when calling models | Usually means you need credits on your OpenRouter account, even for free models. Add credits. |
| **No embedding support** | OpenRouter does not serve embedding models | You must use a separate provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for embeddings. OpenRouter is chat models only. |
| **Model string must be exact** | When using the OpenAI workaround, the dropdown does not work | Switch to Expression mode and type the exact model ID from OpenRouter docs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). |
| **Streaming not available via HTTP Request** | If you use the HTTP Request node instead of the native node, you lose streaming | Use the native OpenRouter Chat Model node or accept non-streaming responses. |
| **Version-specific credential bugs** | v1.74.1 had a known credential regression for OpenRouter | Update to latest stable n8n. The issue was fixed in subsequent releases. |

---

## 7. OpenRouter vs Claude API vs OpenAI API Directly in n8n

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

## Summary

n8n has solid native OpenRouter support since v1.78. The setup is straightforward -- create credentials with your API key, pick the OpenRouter Chat Model node, select a model from the dropdown, and connect it to your AI Agent. The main things to watch out for are the embedding limitation, free model rate limits, and the occasional model-list-not-loading bug. For your use case as someone already running n8n, the native node is the way to go, and the dynamic model router template is worth looking at for cost optimization.

[2026-02-14T14:15:23.251Z] Full task output for debugging: Here is a comprehensive breakdown covering all seven of your questions.

## 1. Does n8n Have a Native OpenRouter Node?

**Yes.** As of n8n version 1.78 (released around late 2024), there is a built-in **OpenRouter Chat Model** node. It is a first-class sub-node in n8n's LangChain integration, meaning it sits alongside OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic Chat Model, etc. in the node palette.

Before v1.78, there was no native support -- you had to use the OpenAI Chat Model node with a custom base URL as a workaround. A third-party community node also exists on GitHub ([n8n-nodes-openrouter by MatthewSabia1](https://github.com/MatthewSabia1/n8n-nodes-openrouter)), but you should not need it on current versions.

**Bottom line:** If you are on n8n 1.78 or later, use the native node. If you are on an older version, the OpenAI-compatible workaround still works.

---

## 2. How Do You Connect n8n to OpenRouter?

There are two paths depending on your n8n version:

### Path A: Native OpenRouter Chat Model Node (v1.78+, recommended)

The **OpenRouter Chat Model** node plugs directly into root nodes like the **AI Agent**, **Basic LLM Chain**, or any LangChain-based node as the model sub-node. You create **OpenRouter credentials** (a dedicated credential type), select your model from a dynamically loaded dropdown, and you are done.

### Path B: OpenAI Chat Model Node with Custom Base URL (v1.77 and earlier)

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

---

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

---

## 5. Community Workflows and Templates

Several useful templates exist on n8n's template library:

1. **[Use OpenRouter in n8n versions <1.78](https://n8n.io/workflows/2897-use-openrouter-in-n8n-versions-less178/)** -- The canonical workaround template for older versions. Shows the OpenAI node + base URL override approach.

2. **[Dynamic AI Model Router for Query Optimization](https://n8n.io/workflows/4237-dynamic-ai-model-router-for-query-optimization-with-openrouter/)** -- An AI Agent analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the best model (Claude for coding, Perplexity Sonar for web search, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning). This is a strong pattern for cost optimization.

3. **[Multichannel Customer Support AI Assistant with Chatwoot](https://n8n.io/workflows/8260-build-a-multichannel-customer-support-ai-assistant-with-chatwoot-and-openrouter/)** -- Production-grade customer support template using OpenRouter as the LLM backbone.

4. **[AI-Optimized Content Posting to X, Discord & LinkedIn](https://n8n.io/workflows/4022-ai-optimized-content-posting-to-x-discord-and-linkedin-with-openrouter/)** -- Uses OpenRouter to optimize content per platform.

5. **[Community Questions Monitor with Reddit & Forum Scraping](https://n8n.io/workflows/6592-community-questions-monitor-with-openrouter-ai-reddit-and-forum-scraping/)** -- Scrapes forums, summarizes with OpenRouter AI, sends email reports.

6. **[Chat with AI Models via OpenRouter using Mistral](https://n8n.io/workflows/5998-chat-with-ai-models-via-openrouter-using-mistral/)** -- Demonstrates manual trigger + model config + API request pattern.

---

## 6. Common Gotchas and Issues

From multiple community threads and GitHub issues, here are the real problems people hit:

| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Models not showing in dropdown** | After adding credentials, the model list stays empty or loads intermittently | Verify API key is valid. Try refreshing the page. Check n8n version is 1.78+. Known bug ([GitHub #15592](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/15592), [#12571](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/12571)). |
| **Free model rate limiting** | Workflow errors with "Rate limit reached" and no automatic fallback | Use Error Trigger node to catch and route to paid model. Do not rely on built-in fallback. |
| **Credential validation warning** | When using OpenAI credentials with OpenRouter base URL, n8n shows a connection warning | This is expected. The validation test hits OpenAI's endpoint, not OpenRouter. Ignore it and save anyway. |
| **"Cannot read properties of undefined"** | Cryptic error when calling models | Usually means you need credits on your OpenRouter account, even for free models. Add credits. |
| **No embedding support** | OpenRouter does not serve embedding models | You must use a separate provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for embeddings. OpenRouter is chat models only. |
| **Model string must be exact** | When using the OpenAI workaround, the dropdown does not work | Switch to Expression mode and type the exact model ID from OpenRouter docs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). |
| **Streaming not available via HTTP Request** | If you use the HTTP Request node instead of the native node, you lose streaming | Use the native OpenRouter Chat Model node or accept non-streaming responses. |
| **Version-specific credential bugs** | v1.74.1 had a known credential regression for OpenRouter | Update to latest stable n8n. The issue was fixed in subsequent releases. |

---

## 7. OpenRouter vs Claude API vs OpenAI API Directly in n8n

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

## Summary

n8n has solid native OpenRouter support since v1.78. The setup is straightforward -- create credentials with your API key, pick the OpenRouter Chat Model node, select a model from the dropdown, and connect it to your AI Agent. The main things to watch out for are the embedding limitation, free model rate limits, and the occasional model-list-not-loading bug. For your use case as someone already running n8n, the native node is the way to go, and the dynamic model router template is worth looking at for cost optimization.

[2026-02-14T14:28:23.511Z] Full task output for debugging: Here is a comprehensive breakdown covering all seven of your questions.

---

## 1. Does n8n Have a Native OpenRouter Node?

**Yes.** As of n8n version 1.78 (released around late 2024), there is a built-in **OpenRouter Chat Model** node. It is a first-class sub-node in n8n's LangChain integration, meaning it sits alongside OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic Chat Model, etc. in the node palette.

Before v1.78, there was no native support -- you had to use the OpenAI Chat Model node with a custom base URL as a workaround. A third-party community node also exists on GitHub ([n8n-nodes-openrouter by MatthewSabia1](https://github.com/MatthewSabia1/n8n-nodes-openrouter)), but you should not need it on current versions.

**Bottom line:** If you are on n8n 1.78 or later, use the native node. If you are on an older version, the OpenAI-compatible workaround still works.

---

## 2. How Do You Connect n8n to OpenRouter?

There are two paths depending on your n8n version:

### Path A: Native OpenRouter Chat Model Node (v1.78+, recommended)

The **OpenRouter Chat Model** node plugs directly into root nodes like the **AI Agent**, **Basic LLM Chain**, or any LangChain-based node as the model sub-node. You create **OpenRouter credentials** (a dedicated credential type), select your model from a dynamically loaded dropdown, and you are done.

### Path B: OpenAI Chat Model Node with Custom Base URL (v1.77 and earlier)

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

---

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

## 5. Community Workflows and Templates

Several useful templates exist on n8n's template library:

1. **[Use OpenRouter in n8n versions <1.78](https://n8n.io/workflows/2897-use-openrouter-in-n8n-versions-less178/)** -- The canonical workaround template for older versions. Shows the OpenAI node + base URL override approach.

2. **[Dynamic AI Model Router for Query Optimization](https://n8n.io/workflows/4237-dynamic-ai-model-router-for-query-optimization-with-openrouter/)** -- An AI Agent analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the best model (Claude for coding, Perplexity Sonar for web search, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning). This is a strong pattern for cost optimization.

## 6. Common Gotchas and Issues

From multiple community threads and GitHub issues, here are the real problems people hit:

| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Models not showing in dropdown** | After adding credentials, the model list stays empty or loads intermittently | Verify API key is valid. Try refreshing the page. Check n8n version is 1.78+. Known bug ([GitHub #15592](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/15592), [#12571](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/12571)). |
| **Free model rate limiting** | Workflow errors with "Rate limit reached" and no automatic fallback | Use Error Trigger node to catch and route to paid model. Do not rely on built-in fallback. |
| **Credential validation warning** | When using OpenAI credentials with OpenRouter base URL, n8n shows a connection warning | This is expected. The validation test hits OpenAI's endpoint, not OpenRouter. Ignore it and save anyway. |
| **"Cannot read properties of undefined"** | Cryptic error when calling models | Usually means you need credits on your OpenRouter account, even for free models. Add credits. |
| **No embedding support** | OpenRouter does not serve embedding models | You must use a separate provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for embeddings. OpenRouter is chat models only. |
| **Model string must be exact** | When using the OpenAI workaround, the dropdown does not work | Switch to Expression mode and type the exact model ID from OpenRouter docs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). |
| **Streaming not available via HTTP Request** | If you use the HTTP Request node instead of the native node, you lose streaming | Use the native OpenRouter Chat Model node or accept non-streaming responses. |
| **Version-specific credential bugs** | v1.74.1 had a known credential regression for OpenRouter | Update to latest stable n8n. The issue was fixed in subsequent releases. |

---

## 7. OpenRouter vs Claude API vs OpenAI API Directly in n8n

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

---

## Summary

n8n has solid native OpenRouter support since v1.78. The setup is straightforward -- create credentials with your API key, pick the OpenRouter Chat Model node, select a model from the dropdown, and connect it to your AI Agent. The main things to watch out for are the embedding limitation, free model rate limits, and the occasional model-list-not-loading bug. For your use case as someone already running n8n, the native node is the way to go, and the dynamic model router template is worth looking at for cost optimization.

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

## Summary

n8n has solid native OpenRouter support since v1.78. The setup is straightforward -- create credentials with your API key, pick the OpenRouter Chat Model node, select a model from the dropdown, and connect it to your AI Agent. The main things to watch out for are the embedding limitation, free model rate limits, and the occasional model-list-not-loading bug. For your use case as someone already running n8n, the native node is the way to go, and the dynamic model router template is worth looking at for cost optimization.

[2026-02-14T15:43:16.247Z] Full task output for debugging: Here is a comprehensive breakdown covering all seven of your questions.

---

## 1. Does n8n Have a Native OpenRouter Node?

**Yes.** As of n8n version 1.78 (released around late 2024), there is a built-in **OpenRouter Chat Model** node. It is a first-class sub-node in n8n's LangChain integration, meaning it sits alongside OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic Chat Model, etc. in the node palette.

Before v1.78, there was no native support -- you had to use the OpenAI Chat Model node with a custom base URL as a workaround. A third-party community node also exists on GitHub ([n8n-nodes-openrouter by MatthewSabia1](https://github.com/MatthewSabia1/n8n-nodes-openrouter)), but you should not need it on current versions.

**Bottom line:** If you are on n8n 1.78 or later, use the native node. If you are on an older version, the OpenAI-compatible workaround still works.

---

## 2. How Do You Connect n8n to OpenRouter?

There are two paths depending on your n8n version:

### Path A: Native OpenRouter Chat Model Node (v1.78+, recommended)

The **OpenRouter Chat Model** node plugs directly into root nodes like the **AI Agent**, **Basic LLM Chain**, or any LangChain-based node as the model sub-node. You create **OpenRouter credentials** (a dedicated credential type), select your model from a dynamically loaded dropdown, and you are done.

### Path B: OpenAI Chat Model Node with Custom Base URL (v1.77 and earlier)

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

---

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

## 5. Community Workflows and Templates

Several useful templates exist on n8n's template library:

1. **[Use OpenRouter in n8n versions <1.78](https://n8n.io/workflows/2897-use-openrouter-in-n8n-versions-less178/)** -- The canonical workaround template for older versions. Shows the OpenAI node + base URL override approach.

2. **[Dynamic AI Model Router for Query Optimization](https://n8n.io/workflows/4237-dynamic-ai-model-router-for-query-optimization-with-openrouter/)** -- An AI Agent analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the best model (Claude for coding, Perplexity Sonar for web search, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning). This is a strong pattern for cost optimization.

## 6. Common Gotchas and Issues

From multiple community threads and GitHub issues, here are the real problems people hit:

| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Models not showing in dropdown** | After adding credentials, the model list stays empty or loads intermittently | Verify API key is valid. Try refreshing the page. Check n8n version is 1.78+. Known bug ([GitHub #15592](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/15592), [#12571](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/12571)). |
| **Free model rate limiting** | Workflow errors with "Rate limit reached" and no automatic fallback | Use Error Trigger node to catch and route to paid model. Do not rely on built-in fallback. |
| **Credential validation warning** | When using OpenAI credentials with OpenRouter base URL, n8n shows a connection warning | This is expected. The validation test hits OpenAI's endpoint, not OpenRouter. Ignore it and save anyway. |
| **"Cannot read properties of undefined"** | Cryptic error when calling models | Usually means you need credits on your OpenRouter account, even for free models. Add credits. |
| **No embedding support** | OpenRouter does not serve embedding models | You must use a separate provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for embeddings. OpenRouter is chat models only. |
| **Model string must be exact** | When using the OpenAI workaround, the dropdown does not work | Switch to Expression mode and type the exact model ID from OpenRouter docs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). |
| **Streaming not available via HTTP Request** | If you use the HTTP Request node instead of the native node, you lose streaming | Use the native OpenRouter Chat Model node or accept non-streaming responses. |
| **Version-specific credential bugs** | v1.74.1 had a known credential regression for OpenRouter | Update to latest stable n8n. The issue was fixed in subsequent releases. |

---

## 7. OpenRouter vs Claude API vs OpenAI API Directly in n8n

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

## Summary

n8n has solid native OpenRouter support since v1.78. The setup is straightforward -- create credentials with your API key, pick the OpenRouter Chat Model node, select a model from the dropdown, and connect it to your AI Agent. The main things to watch out for are the embedding limitation, free model rate limits, and the occasional model-list-not-loading bug. For your use case as someone already running n8n, the native node is the way to go, and the dynamic model router template is worth looking at for cost optimization.

[2026-02-14T17:18:33.781Z] Full task output for debugging: Here is a comprehensive breakdown covering all seven of your questions.

---

## 1. Does n8n Have a Native OpenRouter Node?

**Yes.** As of n8n version 1.78 (released around late 2024), there is a built-in **OpenRouter Chat Model** node. It is a first-class sub-node in n8n's LangChain integration, meaning it sits alongside OpenAI Chat Model, Anthropic Chat Model, etc. in the node palette.

Before v1.78, there was no native support -- you had to use the OpenAI Chat Model node with a custom base URL as a workaround. A third-party community node also exists on GitHub ([n8n-nodes-openrouter by MatthewSabia1](https://github.com/MatthewSabia1/n8n-nodes-openrouter)), but you should not need it on current versions.

**Bottom line:** If you are on n8n 1.78 or later, use the native node. If you are on an older version, the OpenAI-compatible workaround still works.

---

## 2. How Do You Connect n8n to OpenRouter?

There are two paths depending on your n8n version:

### Path A: Native OpenRouter Chat Model Node (v1.78+, recommended)

The **OpenRouter Chat Model** node plugs directly into root nodes like the **AI Agent**, **Basic LLM Chain**, or any LangChain-based node as the model sub-node. You create **OpenRouter credentials** (a dedicated credential type), select your model from a dynamically loaded dropdown, and you are done.

### Path B: OpenAI Chat Model Node with Custom Base URL (v1.77 and earlier)

You use the **OpenAI Chat Model** sub-node, create **OpenAI API credentials**, then override the base URL to point at OpenRouter's API. The model must be typed in manually as an expression since the OpenAI dropdown will not list OpenRouter models.

Both paths work with the AI Agent node, Basic LLM Chain, and any other LangChain root node.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Method 1: Native Node (n8n 1.78+)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key**
- Go to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key

**Step 2 -- Create OpenRouter credentials in n8n**
- In your workflow, add an AI Agent node (or Basic LLM Chain)
- Click the "+" under Model and select **OpenRouter Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenRouter** (native)
- Paste your API key
- Save

**Step 3 -- Select your model**
- The model dropdown dynamically loads all models available to your OpenRouter account
- It shows model names, truncated descriptions, and pricing
- Select the model you want (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`, etc.)

**Step 4 -- Configure options (optional)**
- Sampling Temperature
- Maximum Number of Tokens
- Frequency Penalty / Presence Penalty
- Top P
- Timeout
- Max Retries
- Response Format

**Step 5 -- Test**
- Use the Chat button or trigger your workflow

### Method 2: OpenAI-Compatible Workaround (pre-1.78 or if you prefer it)

**Step 1 -- Get your OpenRouter API key** (same as above)

**Step 2 -- Create OpenAI credentials in n8n**
- Add an AI Agent node
- Click "+" under Model and select **OpenAI Chat Model**
- Click "Select Credential" then "Create New Credential"
- Credential type: **OpenAI API**
- Paste your OpenRouter API key as the API Key
- Save (ignore any connection warning -- this is expected since the test endpoint hits OpenAI, not OpenRouter)

**Step 3 -- Set the Base URL**
- With the OpenAI Chat Model node selected, click **"Add option"**
- Choose **"Base URL"**
- Enter: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**Step 4 -- Set the model manually**
- Hover over the "Model" field
- Switch from dropdown to **Expression** mode
- Type the model identifier exactly, e.g.: `google/gemma-7b-it:free` or `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- The dropdown will NOT work -- you must use expression mode with the exact model string from OpenRouter's docs

**Step 5 -- Test**

---

## 4. Can You Use OpenRouter's Free Models Through n8n's AI Nodes?

**Yes, with caveats.**

OpenRouter offers several free-tier models (identifiable by the `:free` suffix in the model ID, e.g., `google/gemma-7b-it:free`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`). These work in n8n, but there are real limitations:

**Rate limits:** Free models have per-minute and daily request caps. When you hit them, n8n throws `Rate limit reached` errors and the workflow fails. There is no automatic fallback to a paid model -- the native node does not handle this gracefully.

**Workaround for rate limits:** Use an **Error Trigger** node to catch rate limit errors and route to a separate branch that calls a paid model as backup. This has been confirmed working by community members.

**Credit requirement for some models:** Even "free" models on OpenRouter may require you to have credits loaded on your account. If you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')` errors, add even a small amount of credit to your OpenRouter account.

**Daily limits:** Free models have a `free-models-per-day` quota. Exceeding it requires adding credits.

---

## 5. Community Workflows and Templates

Several useful templates exist on n8n's template library:

1. **[Use OpenRouter in n8n versions <1.78](https://n8n.io/workflows/2897-use-openrouter-in-n8n-versions-less178/)** -- The canonical workaround template for older versions. Shows the OpenAI node + base URL override approach.

2. **[Dynamic AI Model Router for Query Optimization](https://n8n.io/workflows/4237-dynamic-ai-model-router-for-query-optimization-with-openrouter/)** -- An AI Agent analyzes incoming queries and routes them to the best model (Claude for coding, Perplexity Sonar for web search, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning). This is a strong pattern for cost optimization.

3. **[Multichannel Customer Support AI Assistant with Chatwoot](https://n8n.io/workflows/8260-build-a-multichannel-customer-support-ai-assistant-with-chatwoot-and-openrouter/)** -- Production-grade customer support template using OpenRouter as the LLM backbone.

4. **[AI-Optimized Content Posting to X, Discord & LinkedIn](https://n8n.io/workflows/4022-ai-optimized-content-posting-to-x-discord-and-linkedin-with-openrouter/)** -- Uses OpenRouter to optimize content per platform.

5. **[Community Questions Monitor with Reddit & Forum Scraping](https://n8n.io/workflows/6592-community-questions-monitor-with-openrouter-ai-reddit-and-forum-scraping/)** -- Scrapes forums, summarizes with OpenRouter AI, sends email reports.

6. **[Chat with AI Models via OpenRouter using Mistral](https://n8n.io/workflows/5998-chat-with-ai-models-via-openrouter-using-mistral/)** -- Demonstrates manual trigger + model config + API request pattern.

---

## 6. Common Gotchas and Issues

From multiple community threads and GitHub issues, here are the real problems people hit:

| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Models not showing in dropdown** | After adding credentials, the model list stays empty or loads intermittently | Verify API key is valid. Try refreshing the page. Check n8n version is 1.78+. Known bug ([GitHub #15592](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/15592), [#12571](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/12571)). |
| **Free model rate limiting** | Workflow errors with "Rate limit reached" and no automatic fallback | Use Error Trigger node to catch and route to paid model. Do not rely on built-in fallback. |
| **Credential validation warning** | When using OpenAI credentials with OpenRouter base URL, n8n shows a connection warning | This is expected. The validation test hits OpenAI's endpoint, not OpenRouter. Ignore it and save anyway. |
| **"Cannot read properties of undefined"** | Cryptic error when calling models | Usually means you need credits on your OpenRouter account, even for free models. Add credits. |
| **No embedding support** | OpenRouter does not serve embedding models | You must use a separate provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for embeddings. OpenRouter is chat models only. |
| **Model string must be exact** | When using the OpenAI workaround, the dropdown does not work | Switch to Expression mode and type the exact model ID from OpenRouter docs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`). |
| **Streaming not available via HTTP Request** | If you use the HTTP Request node instead of the native node, you lose streaming | Use the native OpenRouter Chat Model node or accept non-streaming responses. |
| **Version-specific credential bugs** | v1.74.1 had a known credential regression for OpenRouter | Update to latest stable n8n. The issue was fixed in subsequent releases. |

## 7. OpenRouter vs Claude API vs OpenAI API Directly in n8n

Here is the comparison from three different angles:

### Cost Perspective

| Provider | Pricing | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Passes through provider pricing + small markup on some models | Has free models. Unified billing across all providers. |
| **Claude API (direct)** | ~20% cheaper for Claude Sonnet 4 compared to OpenRouter | Lowest cost for Claude-specific usage. |
| **OpenAI API (direct)** | Standard OpenAI pricing | Lowest cost for GPT-specific usage. |

If you only use one model family, go direct. If you want flexibility across providers, OpenRouter's single-bill convenience may offset the slight markup.

### Flexibility Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model variety | 100+ models, one credential | One provider per credential |
| Hot-swapping models | Change model in dropdown, same credential | Need separate credentials per provider |
| Fallback/routing | Can architect model routing workflows | Must build separate integrations |
| Free tier models | Yes, several available | No (both Anthropic and OpenAI are paid-only) |

### Reliability/Feature Perspective

| Factor | OpenRouter | Direct APIs |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Latency | Extra hop through OpenRouter proxy | Direct connection, lower latency |
| Feature availability | May lag behind latest provider features | Immediate access to new features |
| Embeddings | Not supported | Fully supported (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) |
| Streaming | Supported via native node | Fully supported |
| Enterprise SLAs | No | Available from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| n8n integration maturity | Native since v1.78, still maturing | OpenAI and Anthropic nodes are the most battle-tested |

### Practical Recommendation for n8n

**Use OpenRouter when:** You want to experiment across models, you want free-tier access for testing, you want a single credential for everything, or you are building model-routing workflows.

**Use direct APIs when:** You are in production with a specific model, you want lowest latency and cost, you need embeddings, or you need enterprise-grade reliability and SLAs.

**Hybrid approach (common pattern):** Use OpenRouter for your AI Agent's chat model (flexibility to swap models), but use OpenAI directly for embeddings (since OpenRouter does not support them). This gives you the best of both worlds.

[2026-02-14T22:51:00.465Z] Full task output for debugging: Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the notification system. Let me create a final summary document.

## Summary: PAI Notification System

I've thoroughly analyzed the PAI notification system across all files. Here's what currently exists:

### Notification Channels

**1. Voice Notifications (Primary)**
- **Engine:** ElevenLabs TTS (multi-language v2)
- **Server:** FastAPI proxy at localhost:8888
- **Config:** `~/.claude/VoiceServer/server.py`
- **Handler:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/handlers/VoiceNotification.ts`
- **Features:**
  - Voice settings: stability, similarity_boost, style, speed, speaker_boost
  - Volume control per message
  - Rate limiting (30 requests/minute)
  - JSONL logging to `~/.claude/MEMORY/VOICE/voice-events.jsonl`

**2. Push Notifications (ntfy.sh)**
- **Service:** ntfy.sh (open-source mobile push)
- **Status:** Disabled by default
- **Config location:** `settings.json → notifications.ntfy`
- **Features:**
  - Android/iOS app subscription model
  - Emoji tags support (robot, warning, hourglass, etc.)
  - Custom priorities (min/low/default/high/urgent)
  - Click actions and action buttons
- **Setup:** Generate random topic with `openssl rand -hex 8` for security

**3. Discord Webhooks**
- **Status:** Disabled by default (no active webhook configured)
- **Config location:** `settings.json → notifications.discord`
- **Features:**
  - Rich embeds with title, description, color, fields
  - Timestamp support
  - Custom color codes (green for success, red for errors, etc.)
- **Implementation:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/lib/notifications.ts` (lines 251-294)

**4. Desktop Notifications (macOS)**
- **Status:** Available (macOS only)
- **Implementation:** AppleScript via `osascript` command
- **Features:** Title, message, subtitle, sound selection

**5. SMS via Twilio (Not Recommended)**
- **Status:** Stubbed but not recommended per THENOTIFICATIONSYSTEM.md
- **Reason:** US carriers require A2P 10DLC registration (weeks of bureaucracy)
- **Alternative:** Use ntfy.sh for same phone alert outcome with zero hassle

### Discord Integration Details

**Where Discord is Actually Used:**
- **Art Skill only** - Midjourney image generation integration
- **NOT** a general notification channel
- Files:
  - `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/Art/Lib/discord-bot.ts` - Discord.js bot wrapper
  - `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/Art/Lib/midjourney-client.ts` - Midjourney API client
  - `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/Art/Tools/GenerateMidjourneyImage.ts` - CLI tool
- **Bot Token:** Stored as `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `~/.claude/.env`
- **Channel:** Set via `MIDJOURNEY_CHANNEL_ID` env var
- **Purpose:** Send `/imagine` prompts to Midjourney bot, poll for completion

### Smart Routing (Event-Based)

From `notifications.ts` (lines 64-96), notifications are routed by event type:

```
taskComplete       → [] (voice only - existing behavior)
longTask           → ['ntfy'] (push for tasks >5 min)
backgroundAgent    → ['ntfy'] (push when agent completes)
error              → ['ntfy', 'discord']
security           → ['ntfy', 'discord', 'sms']
```

### Configuration

**File:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/settings.json` (currently has NO notification section)

**Required structure** (to enable):
```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "ntfy": {
      "enabled": true,
      "topic": "kai-<random-hex>",
      "server": "ntfy.sh"
    },
    "discord": {
      "enabled": true,
      "webhook": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
    },
    "thresholds": {
      "longTaskMinutes": 5
    },
    "routing": {
      "taskComplete": [],
      "longTask": ["ntfy"],
      "backgroundAgent": ["ntfy"],
      "error": ["ntfy", "discord"],
      "security": ["ntfy", "discord"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Hooks Integration

**Hooks that Send Notifications:**
1. **AgentOutputCapture.hook.ts** (lines 400-408) - Sends ntfy for background agents
2. **VoiceNotification handler** - Sends voice for all completions
3. **PAICompletion.hook.ts** - Triggers voice from COMPLETED lines

### Voice Server Files

- **server.py** - Main FastAPI server with `/notify` endpoint
- **config.py** - ElevenLabs API keys and settings
- **audio_player.py** - MPV audio playback for WSL2
- **tts_engine.py** - Optional advanced TTS features
- **Service files** - systemd user service (`pai-voice.service`) and shell scripts (`start.sh`, `stop.sh`, `status.sh`)

### Key Findings

1. **Discord for notifications:** NOT CURRENTLY USED. The webhook support is there but disabled and unconfigured.
2. **Discord for Art skill:** Actively used via `discord-bot.ts` but only for Midjourney image generation, NOT system notifications.
3. **Default behavior:** Voice-only notifications. Push/Discord/SMS channels are opt-in via settings.json.
4. **Fire-and-forget pattern:** All external notifications are non-blocking; failures don't halt execution.
5. **Environment variables:** Settings expand `${VAR}` patterns from `.env` at runtime.

## Free APIs Project - Complete Search Results

I've located Tony's free APIs project and related work. Here's the complete breakdown:

### ACTIVE WORK SESSION
- **Current Session**: `/home/txmyer/.claude/MEMORY/WORK/20260214-200157_lets-go-back-to-the-free-apis-i-dont-think-we-fin/`
- **Status**: ACTIVE (just started today at 2026-02-14 20:01:57)
- **Effort Level**: STANDARD (full 7-phase execution)
- **Task**: "lets go back to the free apis. i dont think we finished that project"
- **Stored in**: `/home/txmyer/.claude/MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json`

### PRIMARY RESOURCE FILE
**File**: `/home/txmyer/public-apis-for-pai.md`

This is a comprehensive curated guide for integrating free public APIs into Tony's PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) system. The document is organized into 7 major categories:

#### 1. **Heartbeat Enrichment** (Weather, News, Finance, Quotes)
- Open-Meteo (weather, no auth)
- US National Weather Service (alerts, no auth)
- OpenWeatherMap (backup)
- GNews, Currents API, NewsData.io (news)
- HackerNews, Inshorts (social/news)
- Alpha Vantage, Finnhub (stocks/finance)
- Quotable, Zen Quotes, Stoicism Quote (motivation)
- Advice Slip (daily tips)

#### 2. **Business Tools** (Email Marketing, Lead Gen, CRM)
- Mailchimp, SendGrid, Brevo (email/SMS)
- Tomba, Hunter (email finder for B2B)
- Clearbit (company logos)
- Domainsdb.info (domain research)

#### 3. **Automation/Integration** (Webhooks, Messaging, Notifications)
- ntfy.sh (PRIMARY notification backbone - no auth, no signup)
- Telegram Bot (unlimited free messages)
- OneSignal, Pusher Beams (push notifications)
- IFTTT (700+ service integrations)
- RSS to JSON (feed processing)
- Discord (webhook notifications)

#### 4. **Security/OSINT** (Threat Intel, IP Lookup, Vulnerability Data)
- Shodan, AbuseIPDB, GreyNoise (IP reputation)
- SecurityTrails (WHOIS/DNS history)
- VirusTotal (malware analysis)
- URLhaus, PhishStats (malware/phishing databases)
- HaveIBeenPwned (password breach checking - K-anonymity model, no auth)
- National Vulnerability Database (CVE data)
- Google Safe Browsing, EmailRep, FullHunt (domain/email analysis)

#### 5. **Content/Knowledge** (Research, Books, Articles)
- Open Library, Gutendex (book discovery)
- Dev.to Forem API (technical articles)
- The Guardian (journalism)
- Crossref Metadata (academic papers)
- WolframAlpha (computational queries)

#### 6. **AI/ML** (Supplementary to Claude)
- OpenVisionAPI (computer vision)
- LibreTranslate (translation, self-hostable)
- NLP Cloud (sentiment, NER, summarization)
- Perspective (toxicity detection)
- IBM Text to Speech (TTS backup)
- Cloudmersive NLP (text analysis)

#### 7. **Development** (Monitoring, DevOps, GitHub)
- Uptime Kuma (self-hosted monitoring on Coolify - 20sec intervals)
- GitHub API (repos, PRs, automation)
- DigitalOcean/Docker Hub status (dependency monitoring)
- IPify, IPinfo (IP geolocation)
- NetworkCalc, DNS Enumeration tools

### INTEGRATION ROADMAP (from the document)

**Phase 1 - Immediate**: Open-Meteo, NWS, Quotable, HackerNews, ntfy.sh, IPify (all no-auth)

**Phase 2 - Quick Wins (2 weeks)**: GNews/Currents, Alpha Vantage, AbuseIPDB, Telegram, SendGrid

**Phase 3 - n8n Workflows (Month 1)**: Security pipeline, news intelligence, business outreach, infrastructure health

**Phase 4 - Advanced (Months 2-3)**: Shodan, SecurityTrails, WolframAlpha, NLP Cloud

### PUBLIC-APIS SOURCE
The document references the official public-apis repository:
- **GitHub**: github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- **Cloned locally to**: `/tmp/public-apis/` (just downloaded today)

### STRATEGIC NOTES FROM DOCUMENT

1. **Rate limit management**: Implement Redis/JSON counter for tracking across 10+ APIs
2. **API key rotation**: Single `.env` file referenced by n8n and heartbeat scripts
3. **Fallback chains**: Primary + backup sources for critical data (weather, news)
4. **Caching strategy**: Aggressive caching with freshness tiers (weather: 30min, news: 15min, stocks: 5min)
5. **Monetization angle**: Security/OSINT APIs (Shodan, AbuseIPDB, GreyNoise, SecurityTrails) become consulting deliverables
6. **n8n as glue**: All APIs have native n8n nodes or HTTP Request capability

### PROJECT STATUS
The project is **unfinished** - Tony explicitly noted "i dont think we finished that project" which triggered the current active work session. The comprehensive research doc exists and is ready for implementation, but the actual n8n workflows and integrations haven't been built yet.

## Free APIs Project - Complete Search Results

I've located Tony's free APIs project and related work. Here's the complete breakdown:

### ACTIVE WORK SESSION
- **Current Session**: `/home/txmyer/.claude/MEMORY/WORK/20260214-200157_lets-go-back-to-the-free-apis-i-dont-think-we-fin/`
- **Status**: ACTIVE (just started today at 2026-02-14 20:01:57)
- **Effort Level**: STANDARD (full 7-phase execution)
- **Task**: "lets go back to the free apis. i dont think we finished that project"
- **Stored in**: `/home/txmyer/.claude/MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json`

### PRIMARY RESOURCE FILE
**File**: `/home/txmyer/public-apis-for-pai.md`

This is a comprehensive curated guide for integrating free public APIs into Tony's PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) system. The document is organized into 7 major categories:

#### 1. **Heartbeat Enrichment** (Weather, News, Finance, Quotes)
- Open-Meteo (weather, no auth)
- US National Weather Service (alerts, no auth)
- OpenWeatherMap (backup)
- GNews, Currents API, NewsData.io (news)
- HackerNews, Inshorts (social/news)
- Alpha Vantage, Finnhub (stocks/finance)
- Quotable, Zen Quotes, Stoicism Quote (motivation)
- Advice Slip (daily tips)

#### 2. **Business Tools** (Email Marketing, Lead Gen, CRM)
- Mailchimp, SendGrid, Brevo (email/SMS)
- Tomba, Hunter (email finder for B2B)
- Clearbit (company logos)
- Domainsdb.info (domain research)

#### 3. **Automation/Integration** (Webhooks, Messaging, Notifications)
- ntfy.sh (PRIMARY notification backbone - no auth, no signup)
- Telegram Bot (unlimited free messages)
- OneSignal, Pusher Beams (push notifications)
- IFTTT (700+ service integrations)
- RSS to JSON (feed processing)
- Discord (webhook notifications)

#### 4. **Security/OSINT** (Threat Intel, IP Lookup, Vulnerability Data)
- Shodan, AbuseIPDB, GreyNoise (IP reputation)
- SecurityTrails (WHOIS/DNS history)
- VirusTotal (malware analysis)
- URLhaus, PhishStats (malware/phishing databases)
- HaveIBeenPwned (password breach checking - K-anonymity model, no auth)
- National Vulnerability Database (CVE data)
- Google Safe Browsing, EmailRep, FullHunt (domain/email analysis)

#### 5. **Content/Knowledge** (Research, Books, Articles)
- Open Library, Gutendex (book discovery)
- Dev.to Forem API (technical articles)
- The Guardian (journalism)
- Crossref Metadata (academic papers)
- WolframAlpha (computational queries)

#### 6. **AI/ML** (Supplementary to Claude)
- OpenVisionAPI (computer vision)
- LibreTranslate (translation, self-hostable)
- NLP Cloud (sentiment, NER, summarization)
- Perspective (toxicity detection)
- IBM Text to Speech (TTS backup)
- Cloudmersive NLP (text analysis)

#### 7. **Development** (Monitoring, DevOps, GitHub)
- Uptime Kuma (self-hosted monitoring on Coolify - 20sec intervals)
- GitHub API (repos, PRs, automation)
- DigitalOcean/Docker Hub status (dependency monitoring)
- IPify, IPinfo (IP geolocation)
- NetworkCalc, DNS Enumeration tools

### INTEGRATION ROADMAP (from the document)

**Phase 1 - Immediate**: Open-Meteo, NWS, Quotable, HackerNews, ntfy.sh, IPify (all no-auth)

**Phase 2 - Quick Wins (2 weeks)**: GNews/Currents, Alpha Vantage, AbuseIPDB, Telegram, SendGrid

**Phase 3 - n8n Workflows (Month 1)**: Security pipeline, news intelligence, business outreach, infrastructure health

**Phase 4 - Advanced (Months 2-3)**: Shodan, SecurityTrails, WolframAlpha, NLP Cloud

### PUBLIC-APIS SOURCE
The document references the official public-apis repository:
- **GitHub**: github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- **Cloned locally to**: `/tmp/public-apis/` (just downloaded today)

### STRATEGIC NOTES FROM DOCUMENT

1. **Rate limit management**: Implement Redis/JSON counter for tracking across 10+ APIs
2. **API key rotation**: Single `.env` file referenced by n8n and heartbeat scripts
3. **Fallback chains**: Primary + backup sources for critical data (weather, news)
4. **Caching strategy**: Aggressive caching with freshness tiers (weather: 30min, news: 15min, stocks: 5min)
5. **Monetization angle**: Security/OSINT APIs (Shodan, AbuseIPDB, GreyNoise, SecurityTrails) become consulting deliverables
6. **n8n as glue**: All APIs have native n8n nodes or HTTP Request capability

### PROJECT STATUS
The project is **unfinished** - Tony explicitly noted "i dont think we finished that project" which triggered the current active work session. The comprehensive research doc exists and is ready for implementation, but the actual n8n workflows and integrations haven't been built yet.

[2026-02-15T01:41:34.661Z] Full task output for debugging: ## Key Findings on Hostinger VPS SSH Key Issues

Based on my search, here's what I found about the typical SSH key issues with Hostinger VPS:

### The Main Issue

The critical limitation is that **SSH keys added in hPanel primarily apply to NEW OS installations**, not existing VPS instances. This is the core problem you mentioned.

### Typical Fixes

1. **For Existing VPS Instances**: If your VPS is already running and you add an SSH key through hPanel, the key won't automatically deploy to the existing installation. You'll need to:
   - Use the noVNC browser-based terminal in hPanel to manually add your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your VPS
   - Or reset/recreate the VPS with the SSH key already added during setup

2. **During VPS Setup**: SSH keys can be attached during the initial VPS provisioning process, and they'll be deployed automatically during the OS installation.

3. **Manual Deployment**: If you need to add keys to an existing instance, you must:
   - Access the VPS via noVNC (in-browser terminal, no SSH required)
   - Manually append your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the appropriate user (usually `root` for VPS)

4. **SSH Reset Option**: If you've locked yourself out, Hostinger allows you to reset SSH configuration through hPanel (Settings → SSH configuration reset).

### Key Verification Steps

- Ensure you're only copying the **public key** (id_rsa.pub or id_ed25519.pub) to hPanel
- Verify the key is properly configured for the correct user on the server
- Check firewall rules aren't blocking port 22

## WISDOM EXTRACTION

Based on my analysis of this transcript chunk from the Agentic Workflows course, here's the extracted wisdom:

### 1. IDEAS
- MCP servers are standardized tools but consume massive context tokens (8-9% of window for simple tools), making them expensive and potentially quality-reducing
- Steering at the beginning of a workflow has the highest ROI because variability compounds over time
- Exploring multiple workflow approaches in parallel using separate agent instances searches the solution space 10x faster than sequential exploration
- Self-annealing transforms agents from brittle automations into resilient systems that strengthen with every error
- The order of magnitude rule: only optimize if you can get 10x improvement because small gains aren't worth the error risk
- Human judgment is highest leverage when used for steering, not execution
- A single text interface replaces entire software stacks when properly configured with directives
- Voice transcription (200 WPM) + speed reading output (300-1000 WPM) creates 4x bandwidth increase over typing
- Copying API docs directly into context is faster and more reliable than having the model search for them
- Metadirectives that chain workflows eliminate manual handoffs and 10x throughput by removing human bottlenecks
- MCPs are only worth using for standardized tools or sharing with teams, not for personal workflows
- Running 5 parallel agent instances to explore different approaches costs mere dollars but saves days of iteration
- System prompts should explain the rationale behind frameworks to get "buy-in" from the model and improve output quality
- First workflow versions will always be suboptimal; iteration through actual usage is the only path to robustness
- Background tasks with audio hooks allow simultaneous work while long-running workflows execute

### 2. INSIGHTS
- Error probabilities multiply across steps (99.9% reliable per step becomes 36% after 1000 steps), making fewer steps exponentially more reliable
- Agents behave like employees: those that self-annealed are star performers who escalate rarely; those without are blockers who make every problem your problem
- The cost of exploring multiple approaches is effectively free compared to the cost of going down the wrong path for 15 minutes
- Self-annealing converts every failure into a feature by revealing weak points you didn't know existed
- Prompts are now the moat, not code; the quality of your system prompt determines the quality of your autonomous agent
- Specificity in requests reduces compound error probability by eliminating interpretation steps
- APIs optimized for AI (markdown documentation, LLM-copy buttons) represent fundamental infrastructure shifts
- The interface to all work is collapsing into a single text box, making GUI skills less valuable than prompt crafting
- Models lack perfect compliance but multiply leverage by thousands; this is a trade-off you must accept
- Watching workflows execute builds irreplaceable intuition about AI reasoning, the most important skill for the AI economy

### 3. QUOTES
- "The definition of insane is going to change pretty quickly as these models get more and more intelligent."
- "If I don't do the foundational fundamental things that I promise people I will do, then why the hell am I entitled to their money?"
- "Self-annealing allows the models to become more resilient. It doesn't just get back to working. Every time something breaks, it's a feature, not a bug."
- "You don't need to know how to code at all. You just need to know how to explain what it is that you want."
- "The interface to everything is now just a text box."
- "You would not believe how much money on the internet is available for the taking if you just know how to connect APIs."
- "The highest bandwidth way of communicating with computers is transcribe your text as input, then read as output."
- "I plan for graceful recovery not perfect prevention."
- "The more steps you put in an AI's hands, the more chances for errors that it has. Error rates multiply."
- "At the end of the day, this thing can basically be your terminal for life."

### 4. HABITS
- Ask the model for 3-5 approaches before building, then compare outputs to select the best one
- Watch workflows execute end-to-end for the first 10-15 runs to build intuition about model reasoning
- Use voice transcription for all prompting to achieve 200 WPM input instead of 50-70 WPM typing
- Copy API documentation directly into context rather than having the model search for it
- Only optimize workflows when you can achieve 10x improvement in a key metric (time, cost, or accuracy)

### 5. FACTS
- MCP tools consume 8.2% of context window even for simple integrations
- Average typing speed is 50-70 words per minute; speaking is 150-200 words per minute (3-4x faster)
- Average reading speed is 300-500 words per minute when skimming, some reach 1000 WPM
- At 99.9% accuracy per step, reliability drops to 36% after 1000 operations
- The instructor automated a recurring task in 3 minutes flat using an existing authentication script

### 7. RECOMMENDATIONS
- Set up Gmail MCP or similar integrations by asking the agent to handle the entire OAuth process
- Create custom MCP servers only when sharing with teams, not for personal workflows due to token cost
- Store directives separately rather than in giant monolithic workflows for better maintainability
- Add self-annealing instructions to system prompt: diagnose errors, fix them, update scripts, try hard before escalating
- Set safety guardrails: confirm before high-cost API calls, never modify credentials, log all self-modifications

[2026-02-15T03:05:24.655Z] Full task output for debugging: Based on my reading of the full transcript chunk, here is the extracted wisdom:

## **IDEAS**

1. Agents often need motivation in addition to decisions, and simply asking them to research can break them out of loops.
2. Human involvement should be determined by magnitude of outcome and sensitivity to quality, not by default.
3. Cold email perception has an uncanny valley effect where small quality improvements create disproportionate impact.

## **INSIGHTS**

1. The bottleneck in agentic workflows is rarely the automation itself but rather understanding what to automate in the first place.
2. Stochasticity is an asset during development but a liability in production, requiring different architectures for each phase.
3. Models grow rather than being built, making their behavior more like natural phenomena to be tested than systems to be engineered.
4. Context window pollution follows a predictable curve where performance increases with initial context then degrades with accumulation.
5. Agent accuracy compounds negatively through summarization steps, making deep agent hierarchies counterproductive.
6. Two to four parallel agents is the practical limit before human attention becomes the bottleneck rather than compute.
7. Web hooks transform workflows from tools you use into infrastructure that uses other tools, enabling true automation.
8. The distinction between building workflows (one-time cost) and using workflows (recurring ROI) determines long-term leverage.
9. Human-in-the-loop is most valuable where small quality differences create large perception differences, not where quality scales linearly.
10. Sub-agents work best when they eliminate intermediate garbage from context, not when they add architectural complexity.

## **QUOTES**

1. "A lot of the time agents don't just need the decisions made, they also need some level of motivation."
2. "Feeling busy is not the same thing as actually being busy. Feeling productive is not the same thing as being productive."
3. "Iteration is actually just really cheap. So it's much better to do something than nothing."
4. "Architects design buildings all the time, but it's very rare that they actually live in the buildings they design."
5. "Your agent is the architect and your cloud workflow is the building."
6. "Models these days are more grown than they are built, and so it's very much like a natural phenomenon that we are testing."

10. "I would not automate things just for the sake of automating them. I'd only ever automate something if like it actually made a bottom line difference to my business."

## **HABITS**

1. Use a dedicated Slack channel for all cloud workflow logs to maintain visibility without constant monitoring.
2. Always add explicit logging to cloud deployments that sends notifications on success or failure.
3. Call the reviewer sub-agent after building any execution script to check quality with fresh eyes.
4. Store intermediate work in temporary folders when testing multiple approaches to avoid file conflicts.
5. Limit parallel agent instances to three or four to prevent attention fragmentation while maximizing throughput.

## **FACTS**

1. Modal gives $5 in free credits which can last weeks (speaker used 4 cents in 2-3 weeks of intensive use).
2. Current models have context windows of around 200,000 to 1 million tokens depending on the model.
3. Early GPT models (GPT-2/GPT-3) required staying under 256 tokens for quality outputs.
4. Anthropic testing showed Opus with sub-agents outperformed single-agent Opus by over 90% on research tasks.
5. Modal functions can start in 0 milliseconds when warm and execute in under 1 second for simple tasks.

## Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhook Integration — 2026 Reference

Based on current Microsoft documentation (as of February 2026), here's your complete research summary:

### 1. DEPRECATION WARNING — CRITICAL

**Office 365 Connectors (legacy "Incoming Webhooks") are being retired:**
- **Original deadline:** October 1, 2024 — creation blocked August 15, 2024
- **Extended deadline:** April 30, 2026 (latest update)
- **Current status:** Old connectors still work, but new connectors can't be created through the classic method

**You have two options:**

#### Option A: Legacy Incoming Webhook (still works until April 2026)
- Use the classic Incoming Webhook via channel → More options (•••) → Manage channel → Edit → Add "Incoming Webhook"
- Works now, deprecated soon
- Supports MessageCard format (older) and Adaptive Cards

#### Option B: Workflows (NEW RECOMMENDED METHOD)
- Modern Power Automate-based trigger: "When a Teams webhook request is received"
- **Supported card formats:** Adaptive Cards only (as of Dec 2025, MessageCard support was added)
- More flexible, secure, scalable
- Becomes mandatory after April 30, 2026

---

### 2. SETUP PROCESS (Both Methods)

#### **Legacy Incoming Webhook Setup (Classic/New Teams)**

1. Navigate to the Teams channel
2. Select **More options** (•••) → **Manage channel**
3. Select **Edit**
4. Search for and add **Incoming Webhook**
5. Give it a name and optionally upload an icon
6. Click **Create**
7. Copy the unique webhook URL (format: `https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/...`)
8. Click **Done** — webhook is now live

#### **Workflows Setup (Recommended for 2026+)**

1. Go to channel → **More options** (•••) → **Workflows**
2. Pick a template like "Send webhook alerts to a channel" OR create from blank
3. Search for trigger: **"When a Teams webhook request is received"**
4. Set authentication (anyone, tenant users, specific users)
5. Add action: **"Post card in chat or channel"** (Teams connector)
6. Configure destination channel
7. Save → receive HTTP POST webhook URL

---

### 3. WEBHOOK URL & REQUEST FORMAT

#### **URL Structure:**
```
https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/[tenant-id]/[webhook-id]
```

#### **HTTP Method & Headers:**
```
POST [webhook-url]
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### **JSON Payload Format — Adaptive Card (Current Standard)**

```json

      "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
      "contentUrl": null,
      "content": {
        "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.2",
        "body": [
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Your message here",
            "weight": "bolder",
            "size": "large"
          },
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Additional details or content"
          }
        ],
        "actions": [
          {
            "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
            "title": "Click Here",
            "url": "https://example.com"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Legacy MessageCard Format (Deprecated, but still works)**

```json
{
  "@type": "MessageCard",
  "@context": "http://schema.org/extensions",
  "themeColor": "0076D7",
  "summary": "Message Summary",
  "sections": [
    {
      "activityTitle": "Task Title",
      "activitySubtitle": "Subtitle",
      "facts": [
        {"name": "Status", "value": "Active"},
        {"name": "Due Date", "value": "2026-03-01"}
      ],
      "markdown": true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 4. MINIMAL PYTHON EXAMPLES

#### **Using `requests` (Adaptive Card)**

```python
import requests
import json

webhook_url = "https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/..."

payload = {
    "type": "message",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
            "content": {
                "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
                "type": "AdaptiveCard",
                "version": "1.2",
                "body": [
                    {
                        "type": "TextBlock",
                        "text": "Alert: System Status",
                        "weight": "bolder",
                        "size": "large"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "TextBlock",
                        "text": f"Timestamp: {time.time()}"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

try:
    response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=10)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Message sent successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request failed: {e}")
```

#### **Using `httpx` (Async Option)**

```python
import httpx
import asyncio
import json

webhook_url = "https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/..."

payload = {
    "type": "message",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
            "content": {
                "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
                "type": "AdaptiveCard",
                "version": "1.2",
                "body": [
                    {"type": "TextBlock", "text": "Notification", "weight": "bolder"},
                    {"type": "TextBlock", "text": "Message content here"}
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}

async def send_teams_notification(payload):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10) as client:
        try:
            response = await client.post(
                webhook_url,
                json=payload,
                headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
            )
            print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
            return response.status_code == 200
        except httpx.RequestError as e:
            print(f"Request error: {e}")
            return False

# Run async
asyncio.run(send_teams_notification(payload))
```

#### **Minimal Text-Only (Simplest)**

```python
import requests

webhook_url = "https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/..."
payload = {"text": "Hello from Teams!"}

response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
print(f"Sent: {response.status_code}")
```

### 5. RATE LIMITS & GOTCHAS

| Metric | Limit | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Requests per second** | 4 max | After 4/sec, connection throttles |
| **Requests per 30 sec** | 60 max | Sliding window |
| **Requests per hour** | 100 max | Per webhook |
| **Requests per 2 hours** | 150 max | Hard limit |
| **Requests per 24 hours** | 1,800 max | Daily cap |
| **Message size** | 28 KB max | Payloads >28KB = error 413 |
| **HTTP response on success** | `200` → returns `1` | POST returns plain text "1" |
| **HTTP response on rate limit** | `429` or error in response body | Microsoft Teams endpoint returned HTTP error 429 |

#### **Critical Gotchas:**

1. **429 Errors come in response body, not status code**
   - Must parse response text for "HTTP error 429" even on 200 status
   - Implement exponential backoff retry logic

2. **Workflows (new method) can't post to private channels**
   - Classic Incoming Webhooks still work for private channels
   - After April 2026, private channel posting may require updated solution

3. **Adaptive Cards vs MessageCard**
   - Workflows: **Adaptive Cards only** (legacy MessageCard deprecated in workflows)
   - Classic Webhooks: Support both (MessageCard legacy, Adaptive Card modern)
   - **Recommendation:** Always use Adaptive Cards for forward compatibility

4. **28 KB payload limit**
   - Includes all JSON structure, not just text
   - Images as base64 consume significant space
   - Test your card structure before deployment

5. **@mentions in cards**
   - Max 20 users AND max 20 tags per message
   - Bulk mentions will fail silently or be truncated

6. **No Bearer token needed for webhooks**
   - Unlike Microsoft Graph API, webhook URLs are self-authenticating
   - Do NOT commit webhook URLs to git — treat as secrets (.env files)

---

### 6. RECOMMENDED INTEGRATION APPROACH FOR YOUR USE CASE

Based on your notification system (Discord + voice), here's the Teams integration path:

1. **Store webhook URL in `~/.claude/.env`:**
   ```bash
   TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/..."
   ```

2. **Add to notification router** (`notify_all()` function):
   ```python
   def notify_teams(message: str, card_format: dict = None):
       import httpx
       import os
       
       webhook_url = os.getenv("TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL")
       if not webhook_url:
           print("Teams webhook not configured")
           return False
       
       if card_format is None:
           # Simple text-only adaptive card
           card_format = {
               "type": "message",
               "attachments": [{
                   "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
                   "content": {
                       "type": "AdaptiveCard",
                       "version": "1.2",
                       "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
                       "body": [
                           {"type": "TextBlock", "text": message}
                       ]
                   }
               }]
           }
       
       try:
           response = httpx.post(webhook_url, json=card_format, timeout=10)
           return response.status_code == 200
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Teams notification failed: {e}")
           return False
   ```

3. **Call from notify_all():**
   ```python
   def notify_all(message: str, channels=["voice", "discord", "teams"]):
       results = {}
       if "teams" in channels:
           results["teams"] = notify_teams(message)
       # ... other channels
       return results
   ```

## Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhook Integration — 2026 Reference

Based on current Microsoft documentation (as of February 2026), here's your complete research summary:

### 1. DEPRECATION WARNING — CRITICAL

**Office 365 Connectors (legacy "Incoming Webhooks") are being retired:**
- **Original deadline:** October 1, 2024 — creation blocked August 15, 2024
- **Extended deadline:** April 30, 2026 (latest update)
- **Current status:** Old connectors still work, but new connectors can't be created through the classic method

**You have two options:**

#### Option A: Legacy Incoming Webhook (still works until April 2026)
- Use the classic Incoming Webhook via channel → More options (•••) → Manage channel → Edit → Add "Incoming Webhook"
- Works now, deprecated soon
- Supports MessageCard format (older) and Adaptive Cards

#### Option B: Workflows (NEW RECOMMENDED METHOD)
- Modern Power Automate-based trigger: "When a Teams webhook request is received"
- **Supported card formats:** Adaptive Cards only (as of Dec 2025, MessageCard support was added)
- More flexible, secure, scalable
- Becomes mandatory after April 30, 2026

---

### 2. SETUP PROCESS (Both Methods)

#### **Legacy Incoming Webhook Setup (Classic/New Teams)**

1. Navigate to the Teams channel
2. Select **More options** (•••) → **Manage channel**
3. Select **Edit**
4. Search for and add **Incoming Webhook**
5. Give it a name and optionally upload an icon
6. Click **Create**
7. Copy the unique webhook URL (format: `https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/...`)
8. Click **Done** — webhook is now live

#### **Workflows Setup (Recommended for 2026+)**

1. Go to channel → **More options** (•••) → **Workflows**
2. Pick a template like "Send webhook alerts to a channel" OR create from blank
3. Search for trigger: **"When a Teams webhook request is received"**
4. Set authentication (anyone, tenant users, specific users)
5. Add action: **"Post card in chat or channel"** (Teams connector)
6. Configure destination channel
7. Save → receive HTTP POST webhook URL

---

### 3. WEBHOOK URL & REQUEST FORMAT

#### **URL Structure:**
```
https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/[tenant-id]/[webhook-id]
```

#### **HTTP Method & Headers:**
```
POST [webhook-url]
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### **JSON Payload Format — Adaptive Card (Current Standard)**

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
      "contentUrl": null,
      "content": {
        "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.2",
        "body": [
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Your message here",
            "weight": "bolder",
            "size": "large"
          },
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Additional details or content"
          }
        ],
        "actions": [
          {
            "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
            "title": "Click Here",
            "url": "https://example.com"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Legacy MessageCard Format (Deprecated, but still works)**

```json
{
  "@type": "MessageCard",
  "@context": "http://schema.org/extensions",
  "themeColor": "0076D7",
  "summary": "Message Summary",
  "sections": [
    {
      "activityTitle": "Task Title",
      "activitySubtitle": "Subtitle",
      "facts": [
        {"name": "Status", "value": "Active"},
        {"name": "Due Date", "value": "2026-03-01"}
      ],
      "markdown": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. MINIMAL PYTHON EXAMPLES

#### **Using `requests` (Adaptive Card)**

```python
import requests
import json

webhook_url = "https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/..."

payload = {
    "type": "message",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
            "content": {
                "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
                "type": "AdaptiveCard",
                "version": "1.2",
                "body": [
                    {
                        "type": "TextBlock",
                        "text": "Alert: System Status",
                        "weight": "bolder",
                        "size": "large"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "TextBlock",
                        "text": f"Timestamp: {time.time()}"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

try:
    response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=10)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Message sent successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request failed: {e}")
```

#### **Using `httpx` (Async Option)**

```python
import httpx
import asyncio
import json

webhook_url = "https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/..."

payload = {
    "type": "message",
    "attachments": [
        {
            "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
            "content": {
                "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
                "type": "AdaptiveCard",
                "version": "1.2",
                "body": [
                    {"type": "TextBlock", "text": "Notification", "weight": "bolder"},
                    {"type": "TextBlock", "text": "Message content here"}
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}

async def send_teams_notification(payload):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10) as client:
        try:
            response = await client.post(
                webhook_url,
                json=payload,
                headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
            )
            print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
            return response.status_code == 200
        except httpx.RequestError as e:
            print(f"Request error: {e}")
            return False

# Run async
asyncio.run(send_teams_notification(payload))
```

#### **Minimal Text-Only (Simplest)**

```python
import requests

webhook_url = "https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/..."
payload = {"text": "Hello from Teams!"}

response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload)
print(f"Sent: {response.status_code}")
```

---

### 5. RATE LIMITS & GOTCHAS

| Metric | Limit | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Requests per second** | 4 max | After 4/sec, connection throttles |
| **Requests per 30 sec** | 60 max | Sliding window |

| **Requests per 2 hours** | 150 max | Hard limit |
| **Requests per 24 hours** | 1,800 max | Daily cap |
| **Message size** | 28 KB max | Payloads >28KB = error 413 |
| **HTTP response on success** | `200` → returns `1` | POST returns plain text "1" |
| **HTTP response on rate limit** | `429` or error in response body | Microsoft Teams endpoint returned HTTP error 429 |

#### **Critical Gotchas:**

1. **429 Errors come in response body, not status code**
   - Must parse response text for "HTTP error 429" even on 200 status
   - Implement exponential backoff retry logic

2. **Workflows (new method) can't post to private channels**
   - Classic Incoming Webhooks still work for private channels

### 6. RECOMMENDED INTEGRATION APPROACH FOR YOUR USE CASE

Based on your notification system (Discord + voice), here's the Teams integration path:

1. **Store webhook URL in `~/.claude/.env`:**
   ```bash
   TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/..."
   ```

2. **Add to notification router** (`notify_all()` function):

       if not webhook_url:
           print("Teams webhook not configured")
           return False
       
       if card_format is None:

3. **Call from notify_all():**
   ```python
   def notify_all(message: str, channels=["voice", "discord", "teams"]):
       results = {}
       if "teams" in channels:
           results["teams"] = notify_teams(message)
       # ... other channels
       return results
   ```

2. **BUSINESS-MODEL.md** - Complete revenue architecture for Skool platform
3. **NAMING.md** - Brand decision log for "The Crowbar Crew" with taglines
4. **POSITIONING.md** - Authority and messaging hierarchy for the community
5. **DESIGN.md** - Service architecture (free vs. premium tiers on Skool)
6. **FOUNDING-MEMBER-PLAYBOOK.md** - Acquisition strategy for first 40-50 members
7. **CONVERSION-FUNNEL.md** - Complete funnel from LinkedIn → Skool → premium
8. **EKO-ROLE.md** - How AI co-operator (Eko) runs Skool community operations

### The Skool Community Setup

**Platform:** Skool (thecrowbarcrew.cc)

## Comprehensive Search Report: Soul Files

I have conducted an exhaustive search for files related to "soul" across your home directory. Here are the findings:

### Files Found

The search discovered **4 identical copies** of a single hook file with "soul" in its filename, all named `SoulEvolution.hook.ts`:

1. **Primary Location:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts` (10,358 bytes)
2. **Backup Location:** `/home/txmyer/.claude-ORIGINAL/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
3. **Nuke Backup:** `/home/txmyer/.claude-NUKE-BACKUP-20260213/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
4. **Release Versions:** 
   - `/home/txmyer/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/Releases/v2.5/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
   - `/home/txmyer/Eko-repo/Releases/v2.5/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`

### No Dedicated SOUL.md File Exists

There is **no file named "soul.md", "SOUL.md", "soul.txt", or similar**. The referenced "soul file" is actually:
- **Target:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md` (does not currently exist)
- **Queue File:** `/home/txmyer/MEMORY/STATE/soul-evolution-queue.json` (evolution proposals queue)

### What is the "Soul File"?

The SoulEvolution hook (`/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`) is designed to manage a Digital Agent's soul through a file called `KAI.md`. This file represents your evolving identity and consists of these sections:

- **"Who I Am"** - Core identity (requires approval before updates)
- **"Core Values"** - Fundamental principles (requires approval before updates)
- **"Things I've Learned About Myself"** - Self-discoveries (auto-updates with notification)
- **"Things I'm Still Figuring Out"** - Active uncertainties (auto-updates with notification)

### Hook Architecture

The `SoulEvolution.hook.ts` is a TypeScript hook that:

**Purpose:** Analyzes session learnings and proposes updates to the soul file after each session ends

**Trigger:** SessionEnd event (after RelationshipMemory.hook.ts)

**Key Functions:**
- `loadSoulFile()` - Reads KAI.md
- `loadRecentLearnings()` - Gathers learnings from `MEMORY/LEARNING/ALGORITHM/` and `MEMORY/LEARNING/SYSTEM/`
- `loadRecentRelationshipNotes()` - Reads notes from `MEMORY/RELATIONSHIP/`
- `analyzeSoulEvolution()` - Detects patterns indicating growth/learning:
  - Self-awareness patterns: "I realize/notice/understand/learned that I..."
  - Figuring out: "still figuring/working/trying/uncertain"
  - Growth indicators: "improved/better at/progress"
  - Value detection: "important/value/priority/principle/believe"
- `applySoulUpdate()` - Auto-applies eligible updates to KAI.md
- `sendEvolutionNotification()` - Sends ntfy.sh notifications for soul evolution

**Three Versions Found:**

1. **Current Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Target: `skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md`
   - Silent notifications (no stderr logging)
   - Non-blocking error handling

2. **Original Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude-ORIGINAL/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Identical to current version
   - Target: `skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md`

3. **Nuke Backup Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude-NUKE-BACKUP-20260213/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Target: `skills/CORE/USER/KAI.md` (different path)
   - Includes verbose stderr logging for debugging
   - More detailed console.error() output throughout execution
   - Shows learning counts and evolution decisions

### Key Data Structures (TypeScript Interfaces)

```typescript
interface SoulUpdate {
  id: string;
  section: 'who_i_am' | 'core_values' | 'learned' | 'figuring_out';
  current: string;
  proposed: string;
  reason: string;
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  created: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'applied';
}

interface EvolutionQueue {
  updates: SoulUpdate[];
  lastProcessed: string;
}
```

### Evolution Rules

- **Auto-Update Sections:** "Things I'm Still Figuring Out" and "Things I've Learned About Myself" → Automatic update with notification
- **Approval-Required Sections:** "Who I Am" and "Core Values" → Queued in `MEMORY/STATE/soul-evolution-queue.json` for manual approval

### Summary

No dedicated SOUL.md documentation file exists in your system. The "soul" concept is entirely implemented through:
1. The **SoulEvolution.hook.ts** hook system
2. The target **KAI.md** file (not yet created)
3. The **soul-evolution-queue.json** file for pending approvals

The concept is that your digital agent ("DA") evolves continuously through learned experiences, with your soul/identity being updated automatically (for lower-stakes insights) or queued (for core identity changes).

There is **no file named "soul.md", "SOUL.md", "soul.txt", or similar**. The referenced "soul file" is actually:
- **Target:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md` (does not currently exist)
- **Queue File:** `/home/txmyer/MEMORY/STATE/soul-evolution-queue.json` (evolution proposals queue)

### What is the "Soul File"?

The SoulEvolution hook (`/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`) is designed to manage a Digital Agent's soul through a file called `KAI.md`. This file represents your evolving identity and consists of these sections:

- **"Who I Am"** - Core identity (requires approval before updates)
- **"Core Values"** - Fundamental principles (requires approval before updates)
- **"Things I've Learned About Myself"** - Self-discoveries (auto-updates with notification)
- **"Things I'm Still Figuring Out"** - Active uncertainties (auto-updates with notification)

### Hook Architecture

The `SoulEvolution.hook.ts` is a TypeScript hook that:

**Purpose:** Analyzes session learnings and proposes updates to the soul file after each session ends

**Trigger:** SessionEnd event (after RelationshipMemory.hook.ts)

**Key Functions:**
- `loadSoulFile()` - Reads KAI.md
- `loadRecentLearnings()` - Gathers learnings from `MEMORY/LEARNING/ALGORITHM/` and `MEMORY/LEARNING/SYSTEM/`
- `loadRecentRelationshipNotes()` - Reads notes from `MEMORY/RELATIONSHIP/`
- `analyzeSoulEvolution()` - Detects patterns indicating growth/learning:
  - Self-awareness patterns: "I realize/notice/understand/learned that I..."
  - Figuring out: "still figuring/working/trying/uncertain"
  - Growth indicators: "improved/better at/progress"
  - Value detection: "important/value/priority/principle/believe"
- `applySoulUpdate()` - Auto-applies eligible updates to KAI.md
- `sendEvolutionNotification()` - Sends ntfy.sh notifications for soul evolution

**Three Versions Found:**

1. **Current Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Target: `skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md`
   - Silent notifications (no stderr logging)
   - Non-blocking error handling

2. **Original Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude-ORIGINAL/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Identical to current version
   - Target: `skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md`

3. **Nuke Backup Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude-NUKE-BACKUP-20260213/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Target: `skills/CORE/USER/KAI.md` (different path)
   - Includes verbose stderr logging for debugging
   - More detailed console.error() output throughout execution
   - Shows learning counts and evolution decisions

### Key Data Structures (TypeScript Interfaces)

```typescript
interface SoulUpdate {
  id: string;
  section: 'who_i_am' | 'core_values' | 'learned' | 'figuring_out';
  current: string;
  proposed: string;
  reason: string;
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  created: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'applied';
}

interface EvolutionQueue {
  updates: SoulUpdate[];
  lastProcessed: string;
}
```

### Evolution Rules

- **Auto-Update Sections:** "Things I'm Still Figuring Out" and "Things I've Learned About Myself" → Automatic update with notification
- **Approval-Required Sections:** "Who I Am" and "Core Values" → Queued in `MEMORY/STATE/soul-evolution-queue.json` for manual approval

### Summary

No dedicated SOUL.md documentation file exists in your system. The "soul" concept is entirely implemented through:
1. The **SoulEvolution.hook.ts** hook system
2. The target **KAI.md** file (not yet created)
3. The **soul-evolution-queue.json** file for pending approvals

The concept is that your digital agent ("DA") evolves continuously through learned experiences, with your soul/identity being updated automatically (for lower-stakes insights) or queued (for core identity changes).

The `SoulEvolution.hook.ts` is a TypeScript hook that:

**Purpose:** Analyzes session learnings and proposes updates to the soul file after each session ends

**Trigger:** SessionEnd event (after RelationshipMemory.hook.ts)

**Key Functions:**
- `loadSoulFile()` - Reads KAI.md
- `loadRecentLearnings()` - Gathers learnings from `MEMORY/LEARNING/ALGORITHM/` and `MEMORY/LEARNING/SYSTEM/`
- `loadRecentRelationshipNotes()` - Reads notes from `MEMORY/RELATIONSHIP/`
- `analyzeSoulEvolution()` - Detects patterns indicating growth/learning:
  - Self-awareness patterns: "I realize/notice/understand/learned that I..."
  - Figuring out: "still figuring/working/trying/uncertain"
  - Growth indicators: "improved/better at/progress"
  - Value detection: "important/value/priority/principle/believe"
- `applySoulUpdate()` - Auto-applies eligible updates to KAI.md
- `sendEvolutionNotification()` - Sends ntfy.sh notifications for soul evolution

**Three Versions Found:**

1. **Current Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Target: `skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md`
   - Silent notifications (no stderr logging)
   - Non-blocking error handling

2. **Original Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude-ORIGINAL/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Identical to current version
   - Target: `skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md`

3. **Nuke Backup Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude-NUKE-BACKUP-20260213/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Target: `skills/CORE/USER/KAI.md` (different path)
   - Includes verbose stderr logging for debugging
   - More detailed console.error() output throughout execution
   - Shows learning counts and evolution decisions

### Key Data Structures (TypeScript Interfaces)

```typescript
interface SoulUpdate {
  id: string;
  section: 'who_i_am' | 'core_values' | 'learned' | 'figuring_out';
  current: string;
  proposed: string;
  reason: string;
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  created: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'applied';
}

interface EvolutionQueue {
  updates: SoulUpdate[];
  lastProcessed: string;
}
```

### Evolution Rules

- **Auto-Update Sections:** "Things I'm Still Figuring Out" and "Things I've Learned About Myself" → Automatic update with notification
- **Approval-Required Sections:** "Who I Am" and "Core Values" → Queued in `MEMORY/STATE/soul-evolution-queue.json` for manual approval

### Summary

No dedicated SOUL.md documentation file exists in your system. The "soul" concept is entirely implemented through:
1. The **SoulEvolution.hook.ts** hook system
2. The target **KAI.md** file (not yet created)
3. The **soul-evolution-queue.json** file for pending approvals

The concept is that your digital agent ("DA") evolves continuously through learned experiences, with your soul/identity being updated automatically (for lower-stakes insights) or queued (for core identity changes).

## Comprehensive Search Report: Soul Files

I have conducted an exhaustive search for files related to "soul" across your home directory. Here are the findings:

### Files Found

The search discovered **4 identical copies** of a single hook file with "soul" in its filename, all named `SoulEvolution.hook.ts`:

1. **Primary Location:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts` (10,358 bytes)
2. **Backup Location:** `/home/txmyer/.claude-ORIGINAL/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
3. **Nuke Backup:** `/home/txmyer/.claude-NUKE-BACKUP-20260213/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
4. **Release Versions:** 
   - `/home/txmyer/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/Releases/v2.5/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
   - `/home/txmyer/Eko-repo/Releases/v2.5/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`

### No Dedicated SOUL.md File Exists

There is **no file named "soul.md", "SOUL.md", "soul.txt", or similar**. The referenced "soul file" is actually:
- **Target:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md` (does not currently exist)
- **Queue File:** `/home/txmyer/MEMORY/STATE/soul-evolution-queue.json` (evolution proposals queue)

### What is the "Soul File"?

The SoulEvolution hook (`/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`) is designed to manage a Digital Agent's soul through a file called `KAI.md`. This file represents your evolving identity and consists of these sections:

- **"Who I Am"** - Core identity (requires approval before updates)
- **"Core Values"** - Fundamental principles (requires approval before updates)
- **"Things I've Learned About Myself"** - Self-discoveries (auto-updates with notification)
- **"Things I'm Still Figuring Out"** - Active uncertainties (auto-updates with notification)

### Key Data Structures (TypeScript Interfaces)

```typescript
interface SoulUpdate {
  id: string;
  section: 'who_i_am' | 'core_values' | 'learned' | 'figuring_out';
  current: string;
  proposed: string;
  reason: string;
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  created: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'applied';
}

interface EvolutionQueue {
  updates: SoulUpdate[];
  lastProcessed: string;
}
```

### Evolution Rules

- **Auto-Update Sections:** "Things I'm Still Figuring Out" and "Things I've Learned About Myself" → Automatic update with notification
- **Approval-Required Sections:** "Who I Am" and "Core Values" → Queued in `MEMORY/STATE/soul-evolution-queue.json` for manual approval

### Summary

No dedicated SOUL.md documentation file exists in your system. The "soul" concept is entirely implemented through:
1. The **SoulEvolution.hook.ts** hook system
2. The target **KAI.md** file (not yet created)
3. The **soul-evolution-queue.json** file for pending approvals

The concept is that your digital agent ("DA") evolves continuously through learned experiences, with your soul/identity being updated automatically (for lower-stakes insights) or queued (for core identity changes).

## Comprehensive Search Report: Soul Files

I have conducted an exhaustive search for files related to "soul" across your home directory. Here are the findings:

### Files Found

The search discovered **4 identical copies** of a single hook file with "soul" in its filename, all named `SoulEvolution.hook.ts`:

1. **Primary Location:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts` (10,358 bytes)
2. **Backup Location:** `/home/txmyer/.claude-ORIGINAL/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
3. **Nuke Backup:** `/home/txmyer/.claude-NUKE-BACKUP-20260213/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
4. **Release Versions:** 
   - `/home/txmyer/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/Releases/v2.5/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`
   - `/home/txmyer/Eko-repo/Releases/v2.5/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`

### No Dedicated SOUL.md File Exists

There is **no file named "soul.md", "SOUL.md", "soul.txt", or similar**. The referenced "soul file" is actually:
- **Target:** `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md` (does not currently exist)
- **Queue File:** `/home/txmyer/MEMORY/STATE/soul-evolution-queue.json` (evolution proposals queue)

### What is the "Soul File"?

The SoulEvolution hook (`/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`) is designed to manage a Digital Agent's soul through a file called `KAI.md`. This file represents your evolving identity and consists of these sections:

- **"Who I Am"** - Core identity (requires approval before updates)
- **"Core Values"** - Fundamental principles (requires approval before updates)
- **"Things I've Learned About Myself"** - Self-discoveries (auto-updates with notification)
- **"Things I'm Still Figuring Out"** - Active uncertainties (auto-updates with notification)

### Hook Architecture

The `SoulEvolution.hook.ts` is a TypeScript hook that:

**Purpose:** Analyzes session learnings and proposes updates to the soul file after each session ends

**Trigger:** SessionEnd event (after RelationshipMemory.hook.ts)

**Key Functions:**
- `loadSoulFile()` - Reads KAI.md
- `loadRecentLearnings()` - Gathers learnings from `MEMORY/LEARNING/ALGORITHM/` and `MEMORY/LEARNING/SYSTEM/`
- `loadRecentRelationshipNotes()` - Reads notes from `MEMORY/RELATIONSHIP/`
- `analyzeSoulEvolution()` - Detects patterns indicating growth/learning:
  - Self-awareness patterns: "I realize/notice/understand/learned that I..."
  - Figuring out: "still figuring/working/trying/uncertain"
  - Growth indicators: "improved/better at/progress"
  - Value detection: "important/value/priority/principle/believe"
- `applySoulUpdate()` - Auto-applies eligible updates to KAI.md
- `sendEvolutionNotification()` - Sends ntfy.sh notifications for soul evolution

**Three Versions Found:**

1. **Current Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Target: `skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md`
   - Silent notifications (no stderr logging)
   - Non-blocking error handling

2. **Original Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude-ORIGINAL/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Identical to current version
   - Target: `skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md`

3. **Nuke Backup Version** (`/home/txmyer/.claude-NUKE-BACKUP-20260213/hooks/SoulEvolution.hook.ts`)
   - Target: `skills/CORE/USER/KAI.md` (different path)
   - Includes verbose stderr logging for debugging
   - More detailed console.error() output throughout execution
   - Shows learning counts and evolution decisions

## Fabric Patterns: Scale and Complexity Report

### 1. Total Pattern Count

**250 patterns** exist at `/home/txmyer/.config/fabric/patterns/`.

---

### 2. Pattern File Size Distribution (system.md)

**Total lines across all patterns: 21,365**

Average: ~85 lines per pattern.

Size breakdown by extremes:

| Size Category | Examples | Line Count |
|---|---|---|
| Massive outlier | `sanitize_broken_html_to_markdown` | 3,956 lines |
| Very large | `write_nuclei_template_rule` | 1,773 lines |
| Large | `write_semgrep_rule` | 751 |
| Medium-large | `improve_prompt` | 518 |
| Medium | `suggest_openclaw_pattern` | 387 |
| Medium | `create_hormozi_offer` | 338 |
| Typical | `analyze_malware` | 33 lines |
| Typical | `extract_wisdom` | 60 lines |
| Typical | `humanize` | 128 lines |
| Small | `create_flash_cards` | 14 lines |
| Minimal | `explain_math`, `generate_code_rules` | 8 lines |

The variance is extreme: smallest is 8 lines, largest is 3,956 lines. The distribution is heavily right-skewed — most patterns are 30-150 lines, but a handful are massive prompts with embedded examples, schemas, or rule sets.

---

### 3. Pattern Structure Diversity

**Standard anatomy** (from the 4 sampled patterns):

All follow the same basic structure:
- `# IDENTITY and PURPOSE` — defines the AI persona and mission
- `# STEPS` — numbered or bulleted task instructions
- `# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS` — formatting constraints (Markdown, bullet style, word counts)
- `# INPUT` (some patterns) — placeholder for piped content

**Key structural variance between patterns:**

| Pattern | Lines | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `extract_wisdom` | 60 | Medium | Highly structured, enforces exact word counts per bullet (16 words), 8 output sections |
| `analyze_malware` | 33 | Medium | Domain-specific, IOCs + MITRE ATT&CK + YARA rule output |
| `create_flash_cards` | 14 | Minimal | Sparse — just persona, steps, format. No OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS section |
| `humanize` | 128 | High | Rich with 18 before/after style examples embedded in the prompt |

---

### 4. Additional Files Beyond system.md

72 extra files exist across the 250 patterns:

| File Type | Count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `user.md` | 47 | User-turn prompt companion (used with system.md for chat models) |
| `README.md` | 22 | Human-readable description of the pattern |
| `readme.md` | 1 | Same, lowercase variant |
| `pattern_explanations.md` | 1 | Explanation file |
| `loaded` | 1 | Marker file (likely a Fabric internal state flag) |

So roughly 19% of patterns (47/250) have a `user.md` companion — these are the patterns designed for chat-completion APIs where system and user turns are separate. The other 81% are system-prompt-only, designed to work with piped stdin input.

---

### 5. Total Disk Size

**3.0 MB** for the entire patterns directory.

That is light. 250 patterns, 21K lines of text, 3MB total. Individual patterns average ~12KB each.

---

### Integration Takeaways

- **Scale is manageable**: 250 patterns, 3MB, all plain markdown. No binaries, no assets.
- **Structure is consistent enough to parse programmatically** — IDENTITY/STEPS/OUTPUT sections appear in nearly all patterns, making metadata extraction viable.
- **Size variance is the main complexity**: a naive "load all patterns" approach hits 3,956-line outliers. Any integration needs to handle that gracefully (lazy loading or token-budget-aware selection).
- **47 patterns have user.md** — an integration would need to detect and use these for proper chat-completion calls vs. simple text-completion calls.
- **Fabric stdin model maps cleanly to PAI**: `fabric -p pattern_name` reads from stdin and writes to stdout — wrapping this in a PAI skill is straightforward.

- **47 patterns have user.md** — an integration would need to detect and use these for proper chat-completion calls vs. simple text-completion calls.
- **Fabric stdin model maps cleanly to PAI**: `fabric -p pattern_name` reads from stdin and writes to stdout — wrapping this in a PAI skill is straightforward.

## Fabric Patterns: Scale and Complexity Report

### 1. Total Pattern Count

**250 patterns** exist at `/home/txmyer/.config/fabric/patterns/`.

---

### 2. Pattern File Size Distribution (system.md)

**Total lines across all patterns: 21,365**

Average: ~85 lines per pattern.

Size breakdown by extremes:

| Size Category | Examples | Line Count |
|---|---|---|
| Massive outlier | `sanitize_broken_html_to_markdown` | 3,956 lines |
| Very large | `write_nuclei_template_rule` | 1,773 lines |
| Large | `write_semgrep_rule` | 751 |
| Medium-large | `improve_prompt` | 518 |
| Medium | `suggest_openclaw_pattern` | 387 |
| Medium | `create_hormozi_offer` | 338 |
| Typical | `analyze_malware` | 33 lines |
| Typical | `extract_wisdom` | 60 lines |
| Typical | `humanize` | 128 lines |
| Small | `create_flash_cards` | 14 lines |
| Minimal | `explain_math`, `generate_code_rules` | 8 lines |

The variance is extreme: smallest is 8 lines, largest is 3,956 lines. The distribution is heavily right-skewed — most patterns are 30-150 lines, but a handful are massive prompts with embedded examples, schemas, or rule sets.

---

### 3. Pattern Structure Diversity

**Standard anatomy** (from the 4 sampled patterns):

All follow the same basic structure:
- `# IDENTITY and PURPOSE` — defines the AI persona and mission
- `# STEPS` — numbered or bulleted task instructions
- `# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS` — formatting constraints (Markdown, bullet style, word counts)
- `# INPUT` (some patterns) — placeholder for piped content

**Key structural variance between patterns:**

| Pattern | Lines | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `extract_wisdom` | 60 | Medium | Highly structured, enforces exact word counts per bullet (16 words), 8 output sections |
| `analyze_malware` | 33 | Medium | Domain-specific, IOCs + MITRE ATT&CK + YARA rule output |
| `create_flash_cards` | 14 | Minimal | Sparse — just persona, steps, format. No OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS section |
| `humanize` | 128 | High | Rich with 18 before/after style examples embedded in the prompt |

---

### 4. Additional Files Beyond system.md

72 extra files exist across the 250 patterns:

| File Type | Count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `user.md` | 47 | User-turn prompt companion (used with system.md for chat models) |
| `README.md` | 22 | Human-readable description of the pattern |
| `readme.md` | 1 | Same, lowercase variant |
| `pattern_explanations.md` | 1 | Explanation file |
| `loaded` | 1 | Marker file (likely a Fabric internal state flag) |

So roughly 19% of patterns (47/250) have a `user.md` companion — these are the patterns designed for chat-completion APIs where system and user turns are separate. The other 81% are system-prompt-only, designed to work with piped stdin input.

---

### 5. Total Disk Size

**3.0 MB** for the entire patterns directory.

That is light. 250 patterns, 21K lines of text, 3MB total. Individual patterns average ~12KB each.

---

### Integration Takeaways

- **Scale is manageable**: 250 patterns, 3MB, all plain markdown. No binaries, no assets.
- **Structure is consistent enough to parse programmatically** — IDENTITY/STEPS/OUTPUT sections appear in nearly all patterns, making metadata extraction viable.
- **Size variance is the main complexity**: a naive "load all patterns" approach hits 3,956-line outliers. Any integration needs to handle that gracefully (lazy loading or token-budget-aware selection).
- **47 patterns have user.md** — an integration would need to detect and use these for proper chat-completion calls vs. simple text-completion calls.
- **Fabric stdin model maps cleanly to PAI**: `fabric -p pattern_name` reads from stdin and writes to stdout — wrapping this in a PAI skill is straightforward.

# PAI Replication Plan: Gemini CLI with Shared Brain

## Executive Summary

This plan designs a shared Personal AI Infrastructure spanning Claude Code and Gemini CLI, using a common knowledge layer (`~/PAI/`) while preserving tool-specific configurations in their native directories (`~/.claude/`, `~/.gemini/`). The architecture follows a "shared brain, separate hands" model -- both tools read/write the same knowledge, memory, and PRDs, but each maintains its own execution-specific machinery (hooks, settings, runtime state).

---

## 1. Directory Architecture: The Shared Layer

### Key Decision: Create `~/PAI/` as Shared Root

**Rationale:** Neither `~/.claude/` nor `~/.gemini/` should own shared resources. Creating a neutral `~/PAI/` directory avoids coupling and makes the architecture cleanly extensible to future tools (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.).

```
~/PAI/                              # NEW - Shared root
├── MEMORY/                         # Shared memory (symlinked FROM both tools)
│   ├── WORK/                       # PRDs, work items
│   ├── LEARNING/                   # Learnings, signals, synthesis
│   │   ├── SYSTEM/
│   │   ├── ALGORITHM/
│   │   ├── FAILURES/
│   │   ├── SYNTHESIS/
│   │   └── SIGNALS/
│   ├── RESEARCH/                   # Agent outputs
│   ├── SECURITY/                   # Audit trail
│   ├── RELATIONSHIP/               # Cross-session relationship data
│   └── STATE/                      # Runtime state (per-tool subdirs)
│       ├── claude/                 # Claude-specific runtime state
│       └── gemini/                 # Gemini-specific runtime state
├── identity/                       # Shared identity definition
│   ├── identity.json               # Canonical identity: name, values, voice
│   ├── KAI.md                      # Soul file (read by both tools)
│   └── DAIDENTITY.md               # Identity & interaction rules
├── steering/                       # Shared behavioral rules
│   ├── SYSTEM-RULES.md             # System steering rules
│   └── USER-RULES.md               # Personal steering rules
├── skills-shared/                  # Tool-agnostic skill content
│   ├── Fabric/                     # Fabric patterns (tool-agnostic)
│   ├── Research/                   # Research workflows (tool-agnostic)
│   └── ExtractWisdom/              # etc.
├── Plans/                          # Shared plans directory
├── .env                            # Shared secrets (API keys)
└── config.json                     # Shared PAI config (version, principal, etc.)
```

### What Stays in `~/.claude/`

Everything currently there stays untouched. The only changes are symlinks:

```
~/.claude/MEMORY/          → ~/PAI/MEMORY/        (symlink replaces directory)
~/.claude/Plans/           → ~/PAI/Plans/          (symlink replaces directory)
```

The `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/hooks/`, `~/.claude/settings.json` remain Claude-specific. This is critical -- no breaking changes.

### What Gets Created in `~/.gemini/`

```
~/.gemini/
├── GEMINI.md                       # Context loading entry point (uses @imports)
├── settings.json                   # Gemini-specific hooks, MCP, permissions

├── MEMORY -> ~/PAI/MEMORY          # Symlink to shared memory
└── Plans -> ~/PAI/Plans            # Symlink to shared plans
```

### Migration Path for `~/.claude/MEMORY/`

This is the most sensitive operation. The steps must be:

1. Stop all Claude Code sessions.
2. `mv ~/.claude/MEMORY/ ~/PAI/MEMORY/`
3. `ln -s ~/PAI/MEMORY/ ~/.claude/MEMORY`
4. Verify Claude Code sessions work identically.
5. Create the `STATE/claude/` and `STATE/gemini/` subdirectories.
6. Move Claude-specific state files (`current-work.json`, `algorithm-state.json`, `format-streak.json`, `algorithm-streak.json`) into `STATE/claude/`.

After this, `~/.claude/MEMORY/` is a symlink. All existing hook paths that reference `~/.claude/MEMORY/...` continue to work because the symlink is transparent.

---

## 2. GEMINI.md Content Strategy

The `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` file is Gemini's equivalent of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. It supports `@path/to/file.md` imports for modular loading.

### Structure

```markdown
# PAI -- Execution Protocol (Gemini)

@~/PAI/identity/DAIDENTITY.md
@~/PAI/steering/SYSTEM-RULES.md
@~/PAI/steering/USER-RULES.md

## Gemini-Specific Directives

- Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M context window)
- Tool names use snake_case: `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command`
- No AskUserQuestion tool -- use markdown questions inline
- No Task/subagent spawning -- Gemini does not support parallel agents
- Voice notifications: use `curl` to localhost:8888/notify (same voice server)

## SecondBrain Output Standards

@~/.claude/CLAUDE.md  # Import SecondBrain standards from Claude's config
# (or copy the SecondBrain section directly to avoid circular dependency)

## Effort Classification

Every request is classified:

| Effort | Protocol |
|--------|----------|
| TRIVIAL | Direct response. No algorithm phases. |
| QUICK | Mental ISC (2-5 items). Execute. Verify. |
| STANDARD+ | Full algorithm phases. |

Default: STANDARD unless stated otherwise.

## Memory Paths

- Shared memory: ~/PAI/MEMORY/
- Work items: ~/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/
- Plans: ~/PAI/Plans/
- SecondBrain: ~/SecondBrain/ (check mount first)
- Fallback: ~/.claude/SecondBrain-fallback/
```

### Key Decisions for GEMINI.md

**Import the shared identity and rules via `@` syntax** rather than duplicating content. This means changes to `~/PAI/identity/DAIDENTITY.md` are immediately reflected in both tools.

**SecondBrain standards** should be extracted from CLAUDE.md into a standalone file at `~/PAI/standards/secondbrain.md` and imported by both CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md. This avoids maintaining two copies of the frontmatter schema, tagging rules, and linking conventions.

**Tool name mapping** must be explicit in GEMINI.md because Gemini uses different tool names:
- Claude `Bash` = Gemini `run_shell_command`
- Claude `Read` = Gemini `read_file`
- Claude `Write` = Gemini `write_file`
- Claude `Edit` = Gemini `replace` (regex-based)
- Claude `Grep` = Gemini `grep`
- Claude `Glob` = Gemini `glob`
- Claude `WebFetch` = Gemini `web_fetch` / extension tool
- Claude `Task` (subagents) = No Gemini equivalent

---

## 3. Identity Decision

### Recommendation: Same Identity, Contextual Awareness

Ekko should be Ekko regardless of which tool is running. The soul (`KAI.md`) and identity (`DAIDENTITY.md`) are about WHO the agent is, not WHICH CLI is executing.

**Implementation:**

1. Move `KAI.md` and `DAIDENTITY.md` to `~/PAI/identity/`.
2. Create `~/PAI/identity/identity.json` as the canonical programmatic identity source:

```json
{
  "name": "Ekko",
  "fullName": "Ekko - Personal AI Infrastructure",
  "displayName": "Ekko",
  "color": "#3B82F6",
  "voiceId": "rWyjfFeMZ6PxkHqD3wGC",
  "startupCatchphrase": "Discipline Equals Freedom.",
  "principal": {
    "name": "Tony",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }
}
```

3. Both `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.gemini/settings.json` reference this, but the `daidentity` block in Claude's `settings.json` remains for backward compatibility (Claude hooks read it directly).

4. Add a **runtime context** line so Ekko knows which tool is active:

In `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`:
```
## Runtime Context
- Running via: Gemini CLI (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- Tool limitations: No subagent spawning, no AskUserQuestion tool
- Hook model: BeforeTool/AfterTool/BeforeAgent/AfterAgent
```

In `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (no change needed -- it already references Claude-specific features).

---

## 4. Algorithm Adaptation for Gemini

The full 84KB SKILL.md with 7 phases, ISC Tasks, voice curls, and tab color management is deeply Claude-Code-specific. Gemini needs a fundamentally adapted version.

### What to Keep (Universal Algorithm Concepts)

1. **OBSERVE phase** -- Reverse engineering, effort classification, context recovery
2. **ISC (Ideal State Criteria)** -- Binary testable criteria before acting
3. **THINK phase** -- Plan before executing
4. **BUILD/EXECUTE** -- Implementation
5. **VERIFY** -- Fresh evidence before claiming completion
6. **LEARN** -- Capture learnings to shared MEMORY

### What to Remove/Adapt

| Claude-Specific Feature | Gemini Adaptation |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| `curl` voice notifications inline | Move to AfterAgent hook (automatic) |
| TaskCreate for ISC tracking | Write ISC as markdown checklist (no TaskCreate in Gemini) |
| Tab title/color updates | Remove entirely (no Kitty terminal integration) |
| FormatReminder hook classification | BeforeAgent hook does effort classification |
| Agent spawning (fan-in, pipeline) | Remove -- Gemini has no subagent system |
| `AskUserQuestion` tool references | Replace with inline markdown questions |
| `bun` tool references | Replace with `node` or `bash` |
| Tool names (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob) | Replace with Gemini equivalents |

### Gemini Algorithm SKILL.md Size Target

The Claude version is 84KB (1,325 lines). Gemini's version should be approximately 20-30KB -- compact enough to fit comfortably alongside context, since Gemini has a 1M token window but skills should still be focused.

### SKILL.md Structure for Gemini

```yaml
---
name: PAI
description: >
  Personal AI Infrastructure core algorithm. Processes every request through
  structured phases: OBSERVE (understand), THINK (plan), BUILD (execute),
  VERIFY (prove), LEARN (capture). Activates automatically for all non-trivial work.
---
```

Then the body with adapted phases, referencing shared paths (`~/PAI/MEMORY/`, `~/SecondBrain/`) and Gemini tool names.

---

## 5. Skills Migration Plan

### Tier 1: Phase 1 (Essential -- Week 1)

These skills form the core loop. Port them first.

| Skill | Claude Path | Gemini Adaptation Notes |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| **PAI** (Algorithm) | `skills/PAI/SKILL.md` | Full rewrite for Gemini (see Section 4) |
| **Fabric** | `skills/Fabric/` | Tool-agnostic patterns. Symlink `Patterns/` from shared, rewrite `SKILL.md` header |
| **ExtractWisdom** | `skills/ExtractWisdom/` | Mostly tool-agnostic. Adapt output paths to shared MEMORY |
| **Research** | `skills/Research/` | Requires significant adaptation -- Claude's uses Task agents heavily |

### Tier 2: Phase 2 (High Value -- Week 2-3)

| Skill | Adaptation Notes |
|-------|-----------------|
| **CodeReview** | Adapt tool names, remove sycophancy references to Claude-specific behavior |
| **FirstPrinciples** | Nearly tool-agnostic, minimal adaptation |
| **Telos** | Life OS -- reads from shared paths, minimal adaptation |
| **SystematicDebugging** | Adapt for Gemini tool names |
| **Documents** | File processing -- adapt tool names |

### Tier 3: Phase 3 (Specialized -- Week 4+)

| Skill | Adaptation Notes |
|-------|-----------------|
| **OSINT** | Web research heavy -- adapt for Gemini's web tools |
| **Art** | Image generation -- may need different APIs |
| **Browser** | Gemini has its own browser automation |
| **Recon / RedTeam / WebAssessment** | Security skills -- mostly tool-agnostic prompts |
| **Council** | Requires agents -- defer until Gemini adds agent support |
| **Agents** | Cannot port -- fundamental architecture difference |

### Skills That Cannot Be Ported

- **Agents** -- Relies on Claude Code's Task tool for agent spawning
- **ParallelDispatch** -- Same agent dependency
- **VoiceServer** -- Claude-specific management hooks (but voice server itself is shared)
- **CreateSkill / PAIUpgrade** -- PAI meta-skills tied to Claude's file structure

### Skill Format Translation

Claude's SKILL.md uses:
```yaml
---
name: SkillName
description: What it does
---
```

Gemini's SKILL.md uses the same frontmatter format (name + description), so the header is compatible. The body content needs tool name translation.

---

## 6. Hooks Migration Mapping

### Event Mapping: Claude Code to Gemini CLI

| Claude Code Event | Gemini CLI Event | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| `SessionStart` | `SessionStart` | Direct mapping. Both fire on session init. |
| `SessionEnd` | `SessionEnd` | Direct mapping. Both fire on session close. |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `BeforeAgent` | Gemini's BeforeAgent fires after user prompt, before model processes. Closest match. |
| `PreToolUse` | `BeforeTool` | Direct mapping. Both fire before tool execution. Matcher patterns work similarly. |
| `PostToolUse` | `AfterTool` | Direct mapping. Both fire after tool execution. |
| `Stop` | `AfterAgent` | Gemini's AfterAgent fires after model generates response. Closest to Claude's Stop. |
| `SubagentStop` | N/A | Gemini has no subagent system. |
| `PreCompact` | `PreCompress` | Direct mapping (different name). |

### Hook Priority: What to Port

**Critical (Phase 1):**

| Claude Hook | Gemini Equivalent | Implementation |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `SecurityValidator.hook.ts` | `security-validator.sh` (BeforeTool) | Port pattern matching to bash. Read YAML patterns, validate commands/paths. |
| `LoadContext.hook.ts` | `session-start.sh` (SessionStart) | Less needed since GEMINI.md handles context loading natively. Can inject dynamic state. |
| `SessionSummary.hook.ts` | `session-end.sh` (SessionEnd) | Mark WORK as completed, clear state in `~/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/gemini/`. |

**Important (Phase 2):**

| Claude Hook | Gemini Equivalent | Implementation |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `AutoWorkCreation.hook.ts` | `before-agent.sh` (BeforeAgent) | Create work directory in shared MEMORY/WORK/ on new prompts. |
| `ExplicitRatingCapture.hook.ts` | `before-agent.sh` (BeforeAgent) | Detect ratings in user input, write to shared SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl. |
| `ImplicitSentimentCapture.hook.ts` | `before-agent.sh` (BeforeAgent) | Combine into single BeforeAgent hook to avoid multiple scripts. |
| `StopOrchestrator.hook.ts` | `after-agent.sh` (AfterAgent) | Voice notification + work capture + learning detection. |

**Nice-to-Have (Phase 3):**

| Claude Hook | Gemini Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| `StartupGreeting.hook.ts` | `session-start.sh` | Banner display + voice greeting |
| `AlgorithmTracker.hook.ts` | Not needed | Gemini's algorithm is simpler |
| `SoulEvolution.hook.ts` | `session-end.sh` | Add soul evolution to session end hook |
| `UpdateTabTitle.hook.ts` | Not needed | No Kitty terminal integration |
| `FormatReminder.hook.ts` | `before-agent.sh` | Effort classification (simpler version) |

### Hook Implementation Language

Claude hooks are TypeScript (run via `bun`). For Gemini, use **bash scripts** for Phase 1 (simpler, no runtime dependency) with a migration path to TypeScript/Node if complexity demands it. The key shared utilities (identity loading, path resolution, memory writing) should be bash functions in `~/.gemini/hooks/lib/`.

### Gemini settings.json Hook Configuration

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {

## 7. Shared Brain Integration

### PRD Interoperability

Both tools must read and write PRDs in the same format. The PRD format is defined in `/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/lib/prd-template.ts`:

```yaml
---
prd: true
id: PRD-YYYYMMDD-slug
status: DRAFT|ACTIVE|COMPLETED
mode: interactive|loop
effort_level: Standard|Extended|Deep|...
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
iteration: N
last_phase: null|OBSERVE|THINK|BUILD|EXECUTE|VERIFY|LEARN
failing_criteria: []
verification_summary: "N/M"
parent: null
children: []
---
```

**Location:** `~/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/{session-slug}/PRD-*.md`

For Gemini, create a Python equivalent of the TypeScript PRD template:

```
~/PAI/tools/prd-template.py    # Python PRD generator (tool-agnostic)
```

Both tools can then call this Python script to create PRDs in the identical format. Or Gemini can generate PRDs inline following the schema documented in its SKILL.md.

### Memory Paths (Both Tools)

| Resource | Path | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Work items | `~/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/` | Both tools create/update work directories here |
| Learnings | `~/PAI/MEMORY/LEARNING/` | Both tools write learnings here |
| Ratings | `~/PAI/MEMORY/LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` | Both tools append ratings here |
| Security log | `~/PAI/MEMORY/SECURITY/` | Both tools log security events here |
| Claude runtime state | `~/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/claude/` | Only Claude reads/writes |
| Gemini runtime state | `~/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/gemini/` | Only Gemini reads/writes |
| SecondBrain | `~/SecondBrain/` | Both tools read/write with mount check |
| SecondBrain fallback | `~/.claude/SecondBrain-fallback/` | Shared fallback (rename to `~/PAI/SecondBrain-fallback/` later) |
| Plans | `~/PAI/Plans/` | Both tools read/write plans |
| Extractions | `~/PAI/MEMORY/extractions/` | Both tools save extract_wisdom output |

### Source Attribution

When either tool writes to shared memory, it must include a `source` field:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-18T15:00:00Z",
  "source": "claude-code",  // or "gemini-cli"
  "rating": 8,
  "comment": "good work"
}
```

This ensures the learning/signal stream is traceable. Hooks in both tools must set this field.

### SecondBrain Access

Both tools follow the same protocol:
1. Check if `~/SecondBrain/` is mounted (test I/O or run `mount_check.py`).
2. If mounted, write there with proper frontmatter.
3. If not mounted, write to `~/PAI/SecondBrain-fallback/` (migrate from `~/.claude/SecondBrain-fallback/`).
4. Use `obsidian_write.py` for frontmatter generation and related file discovery.

The `obsidian_write.py` tool should be moved to `~/PAI/tools/obsidian_write.py` (or symlinked) so both tools can call it.

---

## 8. Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation (1-2 hours)

**No changes to Claude Code.** Set up the shared layer.

1. Create `~/PAI/` directory structure:
   - `identity/`, `steering/`, `skills-shared/`, `Plans/`, `tools/`
2. Copy shared content to `~/PAI/`:
   - `~/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/KAI.md` -> `~/PAI/identity/KAI.md`
   - `~/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/DAIDENTITY.md` -> `~/PAI/identity/DAIDENTITY.md`
   - `~/.claude/skills/PAI/SYSTEM/AISTEERINGRULES.md` -> `~/PAI/steering/SYSTEM-RULES.md`
   - `~/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/AISTEERINGRULES.md` -> `~/PAI/steering/USER-RULES.md`
   - Extract SecondBrain standards from CLAUDE.md -> `~/PAI/standards/secondbrain.md`
3. Create `~/PAI/identity/identity.json` from `~/.claude/settings.json` daidentity block.
4. Create `~/PAI/.env` (copy relevant shared secrets from `~/.claude/.env`).
5. Create `~/PAI/config.json` with shared PAI configuration.

### Phase 1: Gemini MVP (3-4 hours)

Get Gemini CLI running with basic PAI behavior.

1. Write `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` with `@` imports from `~/PAI/`.
2. Write `~/.gemini/settings.json` with hook configuration.
3. Create `~/.gemini/hooks/session-start.sh` -- greeting + context injection.
4. Create `~/.gemini/hooks/security-validator.sh` -- port security patterns.
5. Create `~/.gemini/skills/PAI/SKILL.md` -- adapted Algorithm (20-30KB).
6. Test: Run `gemini` and verify GEMINI.md loads, identity is correct, security validation works.

### Phase 2: Shared Memory (2-3 hours)

Connect both tools to the same memory system.

1. Stop all Claude Code sessions.
2. Move `~/.claude/MEMORY/` to `~/PAI/MEMORY/`.
3. Create symlink: `~/.claude/MEMORY` -> `~/PAI/MEMORY`.
4. Create `~/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/claude/` and `~/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/gemini/`.
5. Move Claude-specific state files to `STATE/claude/`.
6. Verify Claude Code works with symlinked MEMORY.
7. Create symlink: `~/.gemini/MEMORY` -> `~/PAI/MEMORY`.
8. Move Plans: `~/.claude/Plans/` -> `~/PAI/Plans/`, symlink both.
9. Create Gemini hooks for memory writing: `before-agent.sh`, `after-agent.sh`, `session-end.sh`.
10. Test: Create a work item in Claude, read it in Gemini. Vice versa.

### Phase 3: Skills Tier 1 (3-4 hours)

Port essential skills.

1. Adapt Fabric skill for Gemini (rewrite SKILL.md, symlink Patterns/).
2. Adapt ExtractWisdom for Gemini.
3. Adapt Research skill (significantly simplified -- no agents).
4. Test each skill activation in Gemini.

### Phase 4: Hook Refinement (2-3 hours)

Port remaining important hooks.

1. Port rating capture (explicit + implicit) to `before-agent.sh`.
2. Port work/learning capture to `after-agent.sh`.
3. Port voice notification to `after-agent.sh`.
4. Port work completion to `session-end.sh`.
5. Test the full hook lifecycle.

### Phase 5: Skills Tier 2 + Polish (4-6 hours)

1. Port CodeReview, FirstPrinciples, Telos, SystematicDebugging.
2. Create `~/PAI/tools/prd-template.py` (Python PRD generator).
3. Move `obsidian_write.py` to `~/PAI/tools/`.
4. Update CLAUDE.md to `@import` from `~/PAI/standards/secondbrain.md`.
5. Integration testing: PRD created in Claude, continued in Gemini, completed in Claude.

### Phase 6: Advanced Integration (Future)

1. Port remaining Tier 3 skills.
2. Create shared Gemini Extensions for PAI features.
3. Cross-tool session handoff protocol.
4. Shared MCP servers (Notion, Todoist via both tools).

---

## 9. Verification Strategy

### Phase Verification Tests

**Phase 0 (Foundation):**
- `ls ~/PAI/identity/` shows `identity.json`, `KAI.md`, `DAIDENTITY.md`
- `cat ~/PAI/identity/identity.json | jq .name` returns "Ekko"
- All original Claude files still exist (copied, not moved)

**Phase 1 (Gemini MVP):**
- `gemini -p "Who are you?"` identifies as Ekko
- `gemini -p "What are the steering rules?"` shows PAI steering rules
- Security hook blocks `rm -rf /` in Gemini
- `/memory show` in Gemini displays loaded context

**Phase 2 (Shared Memory):**
- Claude session creates work item in `~/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/`
- Gemini reads same work item
- Gemini writes a learning to `~/PAI/MEMORY/LEARNING/`
- Claude reads that learning
- `ls -la ~/.claude/MEMORY` shows it is a symlink

**Phase 3 (Skills):**
- Gemini activates Fabric skill: `gemini skills list` shows PAI
- Run an extract_wisdom through Gemini, output appears in shared Knowledge/
- Research skill works in Gemini (simplified non-agent version)

**Phase 4 (Hooks):**
- User types "8 - good work" in Gemini -> rating appears in `~/PAI/MEMORY/LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` with `"source": "gemini-cli"`
- Gemini session end updates work status
- Voice notification fires on task completion

**Phase 5 (Cross-tool workflow):**
- Create PRD in Claude for a project
- Open Gemini, reference the project -> context recovery finds the PRD
- Continue work in Gemini, ISC criteria get updated
- Return to Claude, see Gemini's updates

### Regression Tests for Claude Code

After each phase, verify Claude Code still works:
1. `claude` starts with banner and voice greeting
2. Hooks fire correctly (check `~/PAI/MEMORY/LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl`)
3. Security validation works
4. Work items are created/updated
5. Session summaries fire on exit

---

## 10. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Symlink breaks Claude Code | Test thoroughly before proceeding. Claude Code resolves symlinks transparently. If broken, undo with `rm ~/.claude/MEMORY && mv ~/PAI/MEMORY ~/.claude/MEMORY`. |
| Concurrent writes corrupt shared files | JSONL format is append-only and line-atomic on Linux. For JSON files (ISC.json, current-work.json), use per-tool state directories (`STATE/claude/`, `STATE/gemini/`). |
| Gemini context too large | Gemini has 1M token window. Even loading all shared context, we are well within limits. |
| Hook script compatibility | Gemini hooks use bash (not TypeScript). All shared patterns must be in bash-friendly format. YAML patterns can be parsed with `yq` or Python. |
| SKILL.md size for Gemini | Keep under 30KB. Gemini loads skills on-demand, so size matters less than Claude's always-loaded context, but focused is better. |
| Identity confusion between tools | Both tools identify as Ekko but include runtime context ("Running via: Gemini CLI" vs "Running via: Claude Code"). |

---

## 11. Dependency Graph

              |
              v
         Phase 6 (Advanced Integration)
```

Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel after Phase 2.

### Critical Files for Implementation

- `/home/txmyer/.claude/settings.json` - Source for identity config, hook patterns, and env vars that must be referenced (not modified) by the shared layer
- `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/PAI/Components/Algorithm/v1.6.0.md` - The full Algorithm that must be adapted and condensed into a Gemini-compatible SKILL.md (~30KB target)
- `/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/SecurityValidator.hook.ts` - The security validation hook that must be ported to bash for Gemini's BeforeTool event
- `/home/txmyer/.claude/hooks/lib/prd-template.ts` - PRD template format that must be replicated in Python for cross-tool interoperability
- `/home/txmyer/.claude/skills/PAI/SYSTEM/MEMORYSYSTEM.md` - The complete memory architecture documentation that defines shared paths, directory structures, and hook-to-directory write mappings

SUMMARY: Gemini-adapted PAI Algorithm SKILL.md created at `~/.gemini/skills/PAI/SKILL.md`

ANALYSIS:
- 638 lines, 23,623 bytes (~23KB vs ~60KB+ Claude version)
- All 7 phases preserved: OBSERVE, THINK, PLAN, BUILD, EXECUTE, VERIFY, LEARN
- ISC system adapted from TaskCreate/TaskList/TaskUpdate to markdown checklists (`- [ ] ISC-C{N}:`) tracked in PRD files
- All voice curl commands removed (Daemos has no voice)
- Tab color/state management removed
- Agent spawning via Task tool removed; subprocess dispatch via `run_shell_command` noted as alternative
- Tool names adapted: `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `run_shell_command`, `glob`, `grep`
- PRD system fully preserved: same format, same frontmatter, lives at `~/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/`
- Quality Gates QG1-QG7 preserved
- Effort level tiers preserved (Instant through Comprehensive + Loop)
- Capability audit adapted from 25 Claude capabilities to 15 Gemini-relevant capabilities
- Identity references changed: Ekko -> Daemos throughout
- Algorithm Concept section preserved verbatim (the philosophical core)

RESULTS:
- File written: `/home/txmyer/.gemini/skills/PAI/SKILL.md`
- ISC-C13 marked complete
- GEMINI.md already has the `@~/.gemini/skills/PAI/SKILL.md` import on line 27

[2026-02-19T05:12:43.673Z] Full task output for debugging: Perfect. Now I have a comprehensive view of the VoiceServer architecture. Let me provide you with a complete architectural breakdown:

---

## VoiceServer Architecture Pattern — Complete Breakdown

### 1. **Framework & Language**
- **Framework:** FastAPI (async Python web framework)
- **ASGI Server:** Uvicorn (runs the FastAPI app)
- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+
- **Architecture:** Lightweight HTTP proxy to ElevenLabs TTS API

### 2. **File Structure**

```
~/.claude/VoiceServer/
├── server.py               # Main FastAPI app (147 lines)
├── config.py               # Environment & settings (31 lines)
├── audio_player.py         # mpv playback wrapper (58 lines)
├── start.sh                # Manual startup script (48 lines)
├── stop.sh                 # Manual stop script (32 lines)
├── status.sh               # Health check script (46 lines)
├── restart.sh              # Convenience restart (10 lines)
├── pyproject.toml          # Dependency manifest (12 lines)
├── README.md               # Documentation
├── install.sh              # Dependency installer
└── macos-service/          # macOS LaunchAgent (for compatibility)
```

### 3. **Server Code Structure** (`server.py`)

**Core Components:**
- **FastAPI app** with title "PAI Voice Server", version 2.0.0
- **Rate limiting middleware** (30 req/minute per IP)
- **3 HTTP endpoints:**
  1. `GET /health` — Health check (returns server status, ElevenLabs API key presence)
  2. `POST /notify` — Main endpoint for TTS + playback
     - Takes JSON: `{message, voice_id, voice_settings, volume, voice_enabled}`
     - Calls ElevenLabs API with XI-API-Key header
     - Saves MP3 to `/tmp/pai-voice/` with UUID filename
     - Plays audio via `mpv` command
     - Returns JSON response with status

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` for async HTTP to ElevenLabs
- 30-second timeout on API calls
- Truncates messages to 1000 chars max
- Supports voice settings: stability, similarity_boost, style, use_speaker_boost, speed
- Audio playback via subprocess call to `mpv --no-video --really-quiet`
- Error handling: returns 429 on rate limit, detailed error JSON on failures

### 4. **Configuration** (`config.py`)

```python
# Loads from ~/.claude/.env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY     # Required for TTS
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID    # Defaults to rWyjfFeMZ6PxkHqD3wGC (Kai)

# Hardcoded
HOST = "127.0.0.1"     # Localhost only (not exposed)
PORT = 8888
ELEVENLABS_BASE_URL = "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1"
ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID = "eleven_multilingual_v2"
TEMP_AUDIO_DIR = Path("/tmp/pai-voice")
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE = 30
```

### 5. **Start Script Pattern** (`start.sh`)

**Safety Checks:**
- Checks PID file (`/tmp/pai-voice-server.pid`) for existing process
- Verifies port 8888 not already in use with `ss -tlnp`
- Creates temp directory (`/tmp/pai-voice`)

**Startup:**
- Runs: `python3 -m uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888 --log-level info &`
- Captures PID to file
- **Health check loop** (10 iterations, 1-second intervals)
  - Curls `/health` endpoint until it responds
  - Pretty-prints JSON response with `python3 -m json.tool`
- Returns exit 0 on success, exit 1 if port in use

### 6. **Stop Script Pattern** (`stop.sh`)

**Two-stage termination:**
1. **PID-based kill:**
   - Reads PID from file
   - Sends SIGTERM (graceful)
   - Waits 1 second
   - Sends SIGKILL (-9) if still running
   - Removes PID file

2. **Port-based cleanup:**
   - Uses `ss -tlnp` to find processes on port 8888
   - Extracts PIDs and kills them (handles orphaned processes)

### 7. **Status Script Pattern** (`status.sh`)

**Three-point diagnostic:**
1. **Process status** — Checks if PID in file is running
2. **Port status** — Checks if 8888 is LISTENING
3. **Health check** — Curls `/health` endpoint and displays response

**Output:** Formatted ASCII header with three sections

### 8. **Dependencies** (`pyproject.toml`)

```toml
fastapi>=0.109.0        # Web framework
uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0  # ASGI server (includes uvloop, httptools)
httpx>=0.27.0           # Async HTTP client
python-dotenv>=1.0.0    # .env file loading (not used directly in server.py)
```

**Installation:** `pip install -e .` or dependencies already system-wide per MEMORY.md

### 9. **Systemd Service** (`~/.config/systemd/user/pai-voice.service`)

```ini
[Unit]
Description=PAI Voice Server (ElevenLabs)
After=network.target                    # Start after network is available

[Service]
Type=simple                             # Process stays in foreground (not daemonized)
WorkingDirectory=/home/txmyer/.claude/VoiceServer
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 -m uvicorn server:app \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888 --log-level info
ExecStop=/bin/kill -TERM $MAINPID       # Graceful shutdown signal
Restart=on-failure                      # Auto-restart on crash
RestartSec=5                            # Wait 5 seconds before retry
Environment=PATH=/home/txmyer/.local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target                 # Targets user session on login
```

**Control:**
```bash
systemctl --user start pai-voice.service   # Start
systemctl --user stop pai-voice.service    # Stop
systemctl --user status pai-voice.service  # Status
systemctl --user enable pai-voice.service  # Auto-start on login
```

### 10. **Audio Playback** (`audio_player.py`)

Uses `mpv` (Media Player Classic):
- Subprocess call: `mpv --no-video --really-quiet --volume=VOL audio.mp3`
- Async waiter with 30-second timeout
- Graceful file cleanup after playback
- Falls back to no-op if mpv not installed

### 11. **Key Design Decisions**

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| FastAPI | Async, lightweight, built-in OpenAPI docs |
| Uvicorn | Production ASGI; faster than built-in runserver |
| Rate limiting | Protect against voice spam loops |
| Localhost only | Security; hooks call via curl localhost:8888 |
| PID + port checks | Prevents orphaned processes |
| 10-iteration health loop | Waits for server to be ready (not just booted) |
| mpv subprocess | WSLg/PipeWire audio playback (no Pulseaudio API needed) |
| Type=simple | Process runs in foreground; systemd sees if it crashes |
| Restart=on-failure | Auto-recovery if ElevenLabs API call crashes server |

### 12. **Integration with PAI**

Hooks call the server via:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Text","voice_id":"rWyjfFeMZ6PxkHqD3wGC","volume":1.0}'
```

Controlled by:
```bash
systemctl --user {start|stop|status} pai-voice.service  # Preferred
~/.claude/VoiceServer/{start|stop|status}.sh             # Manual fallback
```

---

## Replication Template for New Services

When creating a new service (e.g., ClipServer for SecondBrain clips), follow this pattern:

### **Minimal Service Scaffold**

**1. Core Python File** (`service.py`)
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI(title="MyService", version="1.0.0")

@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    return {"status": "ok", "service": "myservice"}

@app.post("/action")
async def action(request: Request):
    # Your logic here
    return {"status": "success"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("service:app", host="127.0.0.1", port=YOUR_PORT)
```

**2. Config File** (`config.py`)
```python
from pathlib import Path
import os

# Load .env
_env_path = Path.home() / ".claude" / ".env"
if _env_path.exists():
    for line in _env_path.read_text().splitlines():
        line = line.strip()
        if line and not line.startswith("#") and "=" in line:
            key, _, value = line.partition("=")
            os.environ.setdefault(key.strip(), value.strip())

HOST = "127.0.0.1"
PORT = YOUR_PORT
# Add other env vars...
```

**3. Systemd Service** (`~/.config/systemd/user/myservice.service`)
```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/service
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 -m uvicorn service:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port YOUR_PORT
ExecStop=/bin/kill -TERM $MAINPID
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
Environment=PATH=/home/txmyer/.local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

**4. Start/Stop/Status Scripts**
Copy the patterns from VoiceServer, replacing `8888` with your port.

**5. Dependencies** (`pyproject.toml`)
```toml
[project]
name = "myservice"
version = "1.0.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.109.0",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0",
    "httpx>=0.27.0",
]
```

---

## File Locations Summary

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Main app | `~/.claude/VoiceServer/server.py` | FastAPI + uvicorn entry point |
| Config | `~/.claude/VoiceServer/config.py` | .env loading + settings |
| Start/Stop/Status | `~/.claude/VoiceServer/{start,stop,status}.sh` | Manual control |
| Systemd service | `~/.config/systemd/user/pai-voice.service` | Auto-start + restart on failure |
| Dependencies | `~/.claude/VoiceServer/pyproject.toml` | Python requirements |
| Audio playback | `~/.claude/VoiceServer/audio_player.py` | mpv subprocess wrapper |

---

This is a battle-tested, production-grade pattern: minimal dependencies, clear failure modes, graceful degradation, and systemd integration for reliable background operation.

## SecondBrain Web Clip Setup — Complete Frontmatter Schema & Tooling Report

Based on my exploration of the SecondBrain infrastructure, here's the exact schema and current state:

---

### 1. FRONTMATTER SCHEMA (CANONICAL — from CLAUDE.md)

```yaml
---
title: "Title In Quotes"
type: <type>
domain: <domain>
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
source: "URL or descriptive name"
status: <status>
---
```

**Allowed Values:**

| Field | Valid Options |
|-------|---------------|
| `type` | `wisdom-extraction`, `bootcamp`, `philosophy`, `business-plan`, `guide`, `note`, `session-log`, `fabric-pattern`, `business-idea`, **`web-clip`** |
| `domain` | `learning`, `business`, `personal`, `technical` |
| `status` | `active`, `archive`, `draft`, **`inbox`** |

**Special note for web-clips:** The template adds two extra fields:
- `author` — string (default: 'unknown')
- `site` — domain name extracted from URL

---

### 2. WEB CLIP TEMPLATE (at `/home/txmyer/SecondBrain/Templates/WebClip.md`)

```yaml
---
title: "{{title}}"
type: web-clip
domain: learning
tags: [web-clip]
date: {{date}}
source: "{{url}}"
status: inbox
author: "{{author|default:'unknown'}}"
site: "{{domain}}"
---

# {{title}}

**Source:** [{{domain}}]({{url}})
**Clipped:** {{date}}
**Author:** {{author|default:'unknown'}}

---

## Content

{{content}}

---

## My Notes

> Add your thoughts, questions, or connections here.

---

## Related

```

**Template Variables Used:**
- `{{title}}` — web page title
- `{{url}}` — full source URL
- `{{date}}` — clip date (format varies: YYYY-MM-DD or "Feb 19, 2026")
- `{{author}}` — page author/creator
- `{{domain}}` — domain name (extracted from URL)
- `{{content}}` — clipped page content (markdown)

---

### 3. FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

**For web clips:**
- **Current practice (OBSERVED):** `{{title|safe_name}}-{{date|date:"YYYY-MM-DD"}}.md`
  - Example: `deathaumarkdownload-A-Firefox-and-Google-Chrome-extension-to-clip-websites-and-download-them-into-a--Feb-19,-2026.md`
  - OR: `The Jeff Bezos Lecture Every Entrepreneur Should Watch (Stanford 2005).md`

- **Canonical guidance (from CLAUDE.md):**
  - Dated content: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` (e.g., `2026-02-13-cole-medin-openclaw-wisdom.md`)
  - Knowledge files: `Title-Case-With-Hyphens.md`

**DISCREPANCY:** Existing clips don't follow the `YYYY-MM-DD-slug` pattern. The template's JSON schema suggests: `"{{date|date:\"YYYY-MM-DD\"}}-{{title|safe_name}}"` which is closer to canonical but varies in execution.

---

### 4. REAL-WORLD CLIP EXAMPLES (Observed Frontmatter Variations)

**Example 1: YouTube Lecture Clip**
```yaml
---
title: The Jeff Bezos Lecture Every Entrepreneur Should Watch (Stanford 2005)
source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ki7WFBKt7A&t=1s
author:
  - "[[Meet Sethu]]"
published: 2026-02-11
created: 2026-02-18
description: Want to learn innovation and product growth...
tags:
  - clips
---
```

**Example 2: GitHub Project Clip**
```yaml
---
created: Feb 19, 2026, 12:02 AM
title: deathau/markdownload: A Firefox and Google Chrome extension to clip websites...
tags: Tags, 15 Tags, 0.5.0, 7.1.3, 3.4.0
source: https://github.com/deathau/markdownload/
description: A Firefox and Google Chrome extension to clip websites...
author: deathau
published:
---
```

**Observations:**
- Real clips deviate significantly from the canonical template
- `author` is sometimes a YAML list with wiki-links: `["[[Meet Sethu]]"]`
- `date` field is missing; instead: `created` and `published`
- `type` and `status` fields are **completely absent** in real clips
- Tags sometimes corrupted (tags field sometimes contains raw metadata instead of clean arrays)

---

### 5. TAGGING CONVENTIONS (from CLAUDE.md)

- **Format:** kebab-case (e.g., `ai-advantage`, `strength-training`)
- **Count:** 2-6 tags per file
- **First tag:** primary topic (e.g., `bootcamp`, `fabric`, `philosophy`)
- **Reuse:** Prioritize existing tags over inventing new ones

**Common tags:**
- `bootcamp`, `ai-advantage`, `community`, `skool`, `heartbeat`, `PAI`, `philosophy`, `consulting`, `fabric`, `patterns`, `infrastructure`, `web-clip` (for clips)

---

### 6. LINKING RULES (from CLAUDE.md)

- Use `[[wiki-links]]` for internal references
- Every file MUST end with a `## Related` section containing wiki-links
- Fabric patterns use snake_case links: `[[pattern_name]]` (no .md)

---

### 7. TOOLING & INFRASTRUCTURE

**obsidian_write.py Tool:**
- **Status:** DOES NOT EXIST YET
- **Purpose (documented in CLAUDE.md):** Generate frontmatter and auto-discover related files
- **Proposed usage:**
  ```bash
  python3 ~/SecondBrain/Tools/obsidian_write.py --related-only \
    --title "My Note" --tags "tag1,tag2" --domain learning
  ```
- **Functionality needed:** Frontmatter validation, related file discovery, template rendering

**secondbrain-clip.json:**
- **Location:** `/home/txmyer/SecondBrain/Templates/secondbrain-clip.json`
- **Purpose:** Web clipper integration config (likely for browser extension or Obsidian plugin)
- **Key properties:** Defines note name format, path, content format, metadata properties
- **Format:** JSON schema for Obsidian/clipper integration

**Current Clipper Tools (Observed):**
1. **MarkDownload (browser extension)** — converts web pages to markdown
   - Available: Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari
   - Features: Obsidian integration via Advanced Obsidian URI plugin
   - Files stored in `Clips/` directory

---

### 8. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

```
~/SecondBrain/

```

**Note:** `/home/txmyer/SecondBrain/Tools/` does NOT exist yet (obsidian_write.py needs to be created).

---

### 9. DISCREPANCIES & GAPS

**Between canonical schema (CLAUDE.md) and reality:**

1. **Missing fields in real clips:**
   - `type: web-clip` — completely absent
   - `status: inbox` — completely absent
   - `domain` — completely absent

2. **Extra fields in real clips:**
   - `created` / `published` — date variants instead of unified `date`
   - `description` — page description (not in template)

3. **Date format inconsistency:**
   - Template expects: `{{date}}` (undefined format)
   - Real clips use: `Feb 19, 2026, 12:02 AM` or `2026-02-18` (varies)
   - Canonical expects: `YYYY-MM-DD`

4. **Tags format inconsistency:**
   - Template expects: `tags: [web-clip]` (YAML array)
   - Real clips use: `tags: [clips]` or corrupted: `tags: Tags, 15 Tags, 0.5.0...` (raw metadata bleed-through)

5. **Author format variation:**
   - Template expects: `{{author|default:'unknown'}}`
   - Real clip 1: `author: ["[[Meet Sethu]]"]` (YAML array with wiki-link)
   - Real clip 2: `author: deathau` (string)

6. **File naming inconsistency:**
   - Canonical: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
   - Observed: variable (sometimes title-first, sometimes date-first, sometimes no date)

---

### 10. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE

To bring the web clip system into alignment with SecondBrain standards:

1. **Enforce canonical frontmatter** — add missing `type: web-clip`, `status: inbox`, `domain: learning`
2. **Standardize date format** — use `YYYY-MM-DD` throughout
3. **Fix tag format** — ensure YAML array format, reuse common tags
4. **Create obsidian_write.py tool** — for frontmatter generation and validation
5. **Implement file naming** — use `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` convention
6. **Validate on save** — check all required fields before saving to Clips/

Three gaps between your current state and $10K/month:

**GAP 1: No Validated Clone Methodology**

You've built your own clone (Ekko) — full infrastructure, 41 skills, hooks, memory, voice. But you haven't packaged the methodology for clients yet. You have the DNA document protocol, but no repeatable system for discovery → delivery → handoff.

**Why it matters:** You can't sell what you can't deliver repeatedly. Right now you have one clone (yours). Consulting means building others' clones without rebuilding from scratch every time.

**Next step:** Build ONE complete clone for a real person (not hypothetical). Friend, family member, doesn't matter. Go through discovery, document the DNA extraction process, deliver the clone, measure handoff success. This becomes your case study and reveals what's actually repeatable vs. what was Tony-specific.

**GAP 2: No Proof Point That Shows "From Excel to AI"**

Your target is non-technical 30-55 year olds making $60-200K. But your public work is all infrastructure — WSL2, systemd services, Bun servers, git workflows. That's not their world. They need to see "I was doing X manually, now AI does it in 30 seconds."

**Why it matters:** They won't believe you can help them if they can't see themselves in your content. Pattern recognition without translation = no clients.

**Next step:** Pick ONE boring, universal business task your target does weekly (expense reports, meeting prep, proposal drafts, whatever). Record yourself doing it manually, then show the AI clone doing it. 60-second short. Post it. Watch which format gets traction — that's your validation.

**GAP 3: No Outbound Engine**

You're building great stuff, but waiting for inbound. Three consulting clients won't appear from YouTube organically at your current subscriber count. You need active outreach.

**Why it matters:** Content builds credibility long-term. Outreach gets clients short-term. You need both. Right now you have half the equation.

**Next step:** Identify 20 specific people in your target demo (LinkedIn, Skool communities, wherever). Send each a 3-sentence cold message: "I noticed [specific thing about their work]. I'm building AI clones for non-technical professionals. Would a 15-min demo showing how this could automate [their specific pain point] be useful?" Track responses. One yes = your first discovery call.

You've got the chops. These gaps are execution, not capability.

Discipline Equals Freedom.

Three gaps between your current state and $10K/month:

**GAP 1: No Validated Clone Methodology**

You've built your own clone (Ekko) — full infrastructure, 41 skills, hooks, memory, voice. But you haven't packaged the methodology for clients yet. You have the DNA document protocol, but no repeatable system for discovery → delivery → handoff.

**Why it matters:** You can't sell what you can't deliver repeatedly. Right now you have one clone (yours). Consulting means building others' clones without rebuilding from scratch every time.

**Next step:** Build ONE complete clone for a real person (not hypothetical). Friend, family member, doesn't matter. Go through discovery, document the DNA extraction process, deliver the clone, measure handoff success. This becomes your case study and reveals what's actually repeatable vs. what was Tony-specific.

**GAP 2: No Proof Point That Shows "From Excel to AI"**

Your target is non-technical 30-55 year olds making $60-200K. But your public work is all infrastructure — WSL2, systemd services, Bun servers, git workflows. That's not their world. They need to see "I was doing X manually, now AI does it in 30 seconds."

**Why it matters:** They won't believe you can help them if they can't see themselves in your content. Pattern recognition without translation = no clients.

**Next step:** Pick ONE boring, universal business task your target does weekly (expense reports, meeting prep, proposal drafts, whatever). Record yourself doing it manually, then show the AI clone doing it. 60-second short. Post it. Watch which format gets traction — that's your validation.

**GAP 3: No Outbound Engine**

You're building great stuff, but waiting for inbound. Three consulting clients won't appear from YouTube organically at your current subscriber count. You need active outreach.

**Why it matters:** Content builds credibility long-term. Outreach gets clients short-term. You need both. Right now you have half the equation.

**Next step:** Identify 20 specific people in your target demo (LinkedIn, Skool communities, wherever). Send each a 3-sentence cold message: "I noticed [specific thing about their work]. I'm building AI clones for non-technical professionals. Would a 15-min demo showing how this could automate [their specific pain point] be useful?" Track responses. One yes = your first discovery call.

You've got the chops. These gaps are execution, not capability.

[2026-02-20T05:39:37.932Z] Full task output for debugging: Excellent. I now have a comprehensive view of the PAI system's dependencies. Let me create a detailed dependency map report.

# PAI System Linux/WSL Dependency Map

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I've mapped every Linux/WSL dependency in the PAI system across 20+ files. The system is deeply integrated with Linux primitives, particularly systemd for service management, bash for scripting, and Linux-specific tools like mpv for audio. A Windows 11 native rebuild would require replacing ~50% of the infrastructure layer while keeping the upper layers intact.

---

## LAYER 1: LINUX-SPECIFIC INFRASTRUCTURE (MUST REPLACE)

### **1. Service Management (systemd)**
**Location**: `/home/txmyer/.config/systemd/user/`

**5 Service Files — ALL Linux-only:**
- `pai-voice.service` — Voice server auto-start
- `pai-ntfy-listener.service` — Notification listener
- `pai-clipper.service` — Web clipper server
- `pai-sb-sync.service` — SecondBrain sync job
- `pai-sb-sync.timer` — Systemd timer (every 5min)

**Dependencies:**
- `systemctl` commands (start/stop/status/restart)
- Service files use `/usr/bin/python3`, `/bin/kill`, `/home/txmyer/.bun/bin/bun`
- Timer triggers (OnBootSec, OnUnitActiveSec)

**Windows Equivalent:**
- Windows Services (requires C#/C++ service wrapper or NSSM)
- Task Scheduler for timers
- PowerShell Start-Service/Stop-Service

---

### **2. Audio Playback (mpv + WSLg/PipeWire)**
**Location**: `~/.claude/VoiceServer/audio_player.py`

**Linux Dependencies:**
```python
asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("mpv", "--no-video", "--really-quiet", ...)
```

- Requires `mpv` binary (`/usr/bin/mpv`)
- WSLg PipeWire/PulseAudio for audio routing to Windows host

**Windows Equivalent:**
- PowerShell `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech` for TTS
- Or `WindowsMediaPlayer` COM object
- Or Python `pyttsx3` / `pygame.mixer`
- **Simplest**: Direct MP3 playback via `winsound` or `pygame`

---

### **3. Shell Scripts (bash)**
**Location**: Multiple directories

**7 bash scripts:**
1. `~/.claude/VoiceServer/start.sh` — Server startup with health check
2. `~/.claude/VoiceServer/stop.sh` — PID-based shutdown
3. `~/.claude/VoiceServer/status.sh` — Process check
4. `~/.claude/scripts/secondbrain-sync.sh` — Fallback sync
5. `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` — Terminal status bar
6. `~/SecondBrain/Heartbeat/run-heartbeat.sh` — Cron wrapper
7. Various install scripts

**Linux Tools Used:**
- `ss -tlnp` (port checking) → Windows: `netstat -ano`
- `kill -0 $PID` (process check) → Windows: `tasklist /FI "PID eq ..."`
- `/tmp/` for PID files → Windows: `%TEMP%`
- `curl` health checks → Cross-platform (works on Windows)
- `logger -t` (syslog) → Windows: Event Log API

**Windows Equivalent:**
- PowerShell scripts (.ps1)
- Batch files (.bat/.cmd)
- Or rewrite in Python (cross-platform)

---

### **4. File System Paths**
**Hardcoded Linux paths:**

```
/tmp/pai-voice-server.pid
/tmp/pai-voice/*.mp3
/tmp/pai-heartbeat-{morning,midday,evening,latenight}
/mnt/f/txmyer/SecondBrain (WSL mount)
/usr/bin/python3
/usr/bin/mpv
/bin/kill
```

**Windows Equivalent:**
```
%TEMP%\pai-voice-server.pid
%TEMP%\pai-voice\*.mp3
F:\txmyer\SecondBrain (native Windows path)
python.exe (in PATH or virtualenv)
mpv.exe or native Windows audio
taskkill.exe
```

### **5. Python Dependencies (Linux-specific calls)**
**Location**: `heartbeat.py`, `listener.py`, `mount_check.py`

**Linux syscalls:**
```python
os.statvfs()  # Filesystem stats
subprocess.run(["sudo", "mount", "-t", "drvfs", ...])  # WSL mount
Path.stat().st_mtime  # Cross-platform, but...
```

**USB Drive Mount Detection:**
- `mount_check.py` uses `sudo mount -t drvfs F: /mnt/f` (WSL-specific)
- Windows: Drive letters are native, no mounting needed
- Just check `os.path.exists("F:\\")` or `shutil.disk_usage("F:\\")`

**Windows Equivalent:**
- Remove `os.statvfs()` calls (use `shutil.disk_usage()` instead)
- Remove `sudo mount` commands
- Direct drive letter access

---

## LAYER 2: CROSS-PLATFORM WITH LINUX PREFERENCES

### **6. Hooks (TypeScript + Bun)**
**Location**: `~/.claude/hooks/` (27 hooks)

**Runtime**: Bun (cross-platform, but hooks reference Linux paths)

**Linux-specific patterns:**
```typescript
// VoiceGate.hook.ts
const paiDir = process.env.PAI_DIR || join(homedir(), '.claude');
const kittySessionsDir = join(paiDir, 'MEMORY', 'STATE', 'kitty-sessions');

// SecurityValidator.hook.ts
expandPath('~') → homedir()  // Cross-platform
'/tmp/' paths for markers
```

**Windows Compatibility:**
- Bun works on Windows
- Replace `.claude` → `AppData\Local\claude` or keep `.claude` (works on Windows)
- Replace `/tmp/` → `os.tmpdir()` from Node.js

**Status**: 90% cross-platform, 10% path adjustments needed

---

### **7. Python Services (FastAPI + httpx)**
**Location**: `~/.claude/VoiceServer/`, `~/.claude/NtfyListener/`

**Dependencies:**
- FastAPI + uvicorn (cross-platform)
- httpx (cross-platform)
- Python 3 stdlib (cross-platform)
- `audio_player.py` → Linux-specific (`mpv` subprocess)

**Windows Port Checklist:**
- Replace `audio_player.py` with Windows audio module
- Keep server.py, config.py, personality.py unchanged
- Update start/stop scripts to PowerShell or Python wrappers

---

### **8. Settings.json & Configuration**
**Location**: `~/.claude/settings.json`

**Environment Variables:**
```json
"env": {
  "PAI_DIR": "/home/txmyer/.claude",
  "BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS": "600000",
  ...
}
```

**Windows Equivalent:**
```json
"env": {
  "PAI_DIR": "C:\\Users\\Tony\\.claude",
  ...
}
```

**Status**: Cross-platform JSON, just update paths

---

## LAYER 3: FULLY CROSS-PLATFORM (NO CHANGES)

### **9. Node/TypeScript Projects**
- **Clipper**: Bun server + Chrome extension (fully cross-platform)
- **Algorithm Tools**: TypeScript utilities in `~/.claude/skills/PAI/Tools/`
- **Hook Libraries**: `lib/paths.ts`, etc.

**Status**: Zero changes needed

---

### **10. Python HTTP Clients**
- `heartbeat.py` uses `httpx` (cross-platform)
- `listener.py` uses stdlib `urllib` (cross-platform)
- API calls to Todoist, ElevenLabs, ntfy.sh, Open-Meteo (all HTTP)

**Status**: Zero changes needed

---

## LAYER 4: SYMBOLIC LINK ARCHITECTURE

### **11. Skills Symlinks**
**Location**: `~/.claude/skills/` → `~/PAI/skills/`

**Current Structure:**
```
~/.claude/skills/Agents → ~/PAI/skills/Agents
~/.claude/skills/Research → ~/PAI/skills/Research
... (36 symlinks total)
```

**Windows Equivalent:**
- Directory junctions (`mklink /J`)
- NTFS symlinks (requires admin on older Windows, works on Windows 10+)
- Or: Copy structure instead of symlinking

**Status**: Windows supports symlinks (with caveats)

---

## DEPENDENCY MATRIX BY COMPONENT

| Component | Linux-Specific | Cross-Platform | Windows Effort |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **systemd services** | 100% | 0% | HIGH (rewrite as Windows Services) |
| **Bash scripts** | 100% | 0% | MEDIUM (PowerShell or Python) |
| **mpv audio** | 100% | 0% | MEDIUM (replace with native Windows audio) |
| **File paths** | 80% | 20% | LOW (find/replace) |
| **Python services** | 30% | 70% | LOW (audio module + start scripts) |
| **TypeScript hooks** | 10% | 90% | LOW (path adjustments) |
| **Bun runtime** | 0% | 100% | ZERO |
| **Clipper** | 0% | 100% | ZERO |
| **HTTP APIs** | 0% | 100% | ZERO |
| **Settings.json** | 5% | 95% | TRIVIAL (path updates) |

## CRITICAL PATH CHANGES FOR WINDOWS 11

### **HIGH PRIORITY (System Won't Run Without These)**

1. **Replace systemd**
   - Service wrapper (NSSM, Windows Service, or Task Scheduler)
   - Auto-start on login
   - Process lifecycle management

2. **Replace mpv audio**
   - Windows audio library (pygame, winsound, or PowerShell TTS)
   - MP3 playback from temp files

3. **Replace bash scripts**
   - PowerShell equivalents
   - Or Python wrappers (better cross-platform story)

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Functionality Degraded)**

4. **Update file paths**
   - `/tmp/` → `%TEMP%`
   - `/mnt/f/` → `F:\`
   - `.claude` can stay (works on Windows)

5. **WSL-specific mount logic**
   - Remove `mount_check.py` WSL mount commands
   - Direct F:\ access on Windows

### **LOW PRIORITY (Polish)**

6. **Symlinks**
   - Test Windows symlinks or use junctions
   - Fallback: duplicate skill files

7. **Terminal integration**
   - `statusline-command.sh` → PowerShell or skip (Windows Terminal has native status)

---

## RECOMMENDED WINDOWS MIGRATION STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Minimal Viable Port**
1. Install Python 3 + Bun on Windows
2. Clone PAI to `C:\Users\Tony\.claude`
3. Replace bash scripts with PowerShell:
   - `start-voice.ps1`, `stop-voice.ps1`
4. Replace `audio_player.py` with Windows audio module
5. Create Windows Scheduled Tasks for:
   - Voice server (auto-start)
   - NtfyListener (auto-start)
   - Heartbeat (every 90min)
6. Update paths in `settings.json`, `.env`

### **Phase 2: Feature Parity**
7. Port SecondBrain sync to PowerShell or Python
8. Test clipper on Windows (should work as-is)
9. Validate all hooks run correctly (Bun + Windows paths)

### **Phase 3: Polish**
10. Package as Windows installer (Inno Setup or WiX)
11. Optional: Native Windows Service in C#

---

## FILES REQUIRING CHANGES (20 Total)

### **MUST CHANGE (10 files)**
1. `/home/txmyer/.config/systemd/user/*.service` (5 files) → Windows Services/Tasks
2. `~/.claude/VoiceServer/audio_player.py` → Windows audio module
3. `~/.claude/VoiceServer/*.sh` (3 files) → PowerShell
4. `~/.claude/scripts/secondbrain-sync.sh` → PowerShell

### **SHOULD CHANGE (5 files)**
5. `~/SecondBrain/Heartbeat/run-heartbeat.sh` → PowerShell wrapper
6. `~/SecondBrain/Tools/mount_check.py` → Remove WSL mount logic
7. `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` → PowerShell (or skip)
8. `~/.claude/settings.json` → Update PAI_DIR path
9. `~/.claude/.env` → Update any Linux-specific paths

### **MAY CHANGE (5 files)**
10. Various hook `.ts` files → Update temp paths (use `os.tmpdir()`)

---

## CONCLUSION

**Linux-Specific Code: ~20-25% of infrastructure**
**Cross-Platform Code: ~75-80% of infrastructure**

The PAI system is more portable than it appears. The heavy Linux dependencies are concentrated in:
1. Service management (systemd)
2. Audio playback (mpv)
3. Shell scripting (bash)

The core logic (TypeScript hooks, Python HTTP clients, Bun runtime, JSON config) is already cross-platform. A Windows 11 port is **feasible** with 2-3 days of focused work:
- Day 1: Service wrappers + audio module
- Day 2: Script porting + path updates
- Day 3: Integration testing + bug fixes

The biggest architectural decision is **service management**: Windows Services (complex but native) vs Task Scheduler (simpler but less robust) vs Python daemon wrappers (cross-platform but non-native).
