## Founder’s Voice

So the thing about business is it’s never really “starting a business,” it’s more like you’re trying to escape gravity with a half-built rocket while still showing up to your 9–5 on time and pretending you care about sprint retros. You keep telling yourself you’re going to “find 10–20 hours a week,” but what you’re actually doing is negotiating with your future self: how much pain now for how much optionality later.

You look at this whole stack you’ve Frankensteined together — Perplexity, Comet, Gemini, n8n, Docker, NAS — and you’re like, there’s definitely a product hiding in here somewhere, some neat little “Automation-as-a-Service for small businesses” thing that looks clean and simple on the landing page but behind the scenes it’s duct tape, YAML, and an embarrassing number of environment variables. Clients don’t care whether it’s on a NAS or Vultr or some random Docker host, but you care, because the whole point is repeatability: solve it once, sell it many times, ship a black-white-gold box that feels like “this is the grown-up, enterprise version of the stuff I already do for myself at 2 a.m.”

There’s this recurring thought: “I’m basically building a lab around my own life.” The personal finance app, the life dashboard clone, the AI stack comparison spreadsheet, the senior AI training idea — they’re all just experiments pretending to be separate projects. You watch how your own systems break under real usage: where you stop entering transactions, where automations silently fail, where reminders become noise, and you think, “if *I* can’t stick to this and I actually like this stuff, what chance does a normal user have?” That’s the product research: build for yourself, then assume clients will do 30–50% of what you do on your best week and price around that level of reality, not the fantasy persona everyone writes about in their Notion docs.

You keep circling the same core story: “I’m leaving my job, but I’m not doing a cute little side hustle, I’m building infrastructure.” Infrastructure in your case is not just servers and containers; it’s routines, calendars, prompts, templates, Markdown docs, and some rule like “don’t quit until revenue hits 75% of salary for 3 months straight.” There’s a part of you that’s impatient and wants to jump, and another part that’s done the math on health insurance, debt, random plumbing emergencies, and knows that romanticizing the leap is how people end up back in a worse job six months later.

And then there’s the AI stack obsession, which is half tool selection and half identity crisis. You’re not asking “is Gemini better than Claude or ChatGPT,” you’re asking “what’s the minimum stack I can commit to without constantly second-guessing myself every time a new model drops.” You want one model that thinks, one agent that executes, one browser that sees the world, and then everything else is just plumbing — n8n flows, ClickUp/Notion/Calendar glue, maybe Manus as the over-caffeinated junior dev you keep on a short leash. The business angle buried in there is, if you can tame this chaos for yourself and name it clearly, you can sell that clarity to other people who are drowning in options and just want “the stack that works.”

You’ve basically decided your brand is “calm, opinionated systems for people who don’t have time to think about systems,” but you haven’t fully said that out loud yet. That’s why the aesthetics matter more than you admit — black, white, gold, clean dashboards, seniors or small business owners or whoever being told, “Here, this is your control panel, don’t worry about what’s underneath.” Underneath is your mess: time-blocked evenings, Docker containers on a NAS humming away in the corner, spreadsheets comparing token prices across LLMs, and half-finished web apps that are really prototypes for offers you haven’t launched yet.

And the funny thing is, the business isn’t one idea, it’s the meta-skill you’re rehearsing: translating “I’m overwhelmed, but I want leverage” into concrete infrastructure, one workflow at a time. If you can keep doing that — for yourself, then for one client, then ten — at some point it just quietly stops being “a plan to leave my job” and starts being the job.
