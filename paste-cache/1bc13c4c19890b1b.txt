# Fabric Patterns — Curated for Your Projects

## How to Use These

Each pattern below is a **system prompt** you can copy and use in:
- **Claude conversations** (paste as your first message or instructions)
- **n8n AI nodes** (set as the system prompt field)
- **Obsidian vault** (save as templates in a `/prompts` folder)

To get the actual full prompt text, visit:
`https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/data/patterns/[pattern_name]/system.md`

Every pattern follows the same structure:
```
# IDENTITY and PURPOSE  → Who the AI should "be"
# STEPS                 → What it should do, in order
# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS   → How to format the response
# INPUT                 → Where your content goes
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with 3-5 patterns** — don't try to use all of these at once
2. **Copy the system.md content** from GitHub into your Obsidian vault under a `/fabric-prompts` folder
3. **Test each one** in Claude first to see if the output fits your needs
4. **Customize them** — change the instructions to fit your specific audience (seniors learning AI)
5. **Graduate the best ones to n8n** — once you know a pattern works well, wire it into an automation workflow

### Suggested Starting Set:
- `extract_wisdom` (process learning content)
- `summarize` (condense for students)
- `explain_terms` (make jargon accessible)
- `improve_prompt` (improve everything you build)
- `official_pattern_template` (learn to make your own)
