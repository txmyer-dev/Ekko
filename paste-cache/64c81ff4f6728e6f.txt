## Email 3: Community Guidelines (Day 3)

**Subject:** How we keep [Community Name] valuable (and fun)

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

You've probably noticed that [Community Name] feels different from other online communities. That's intentional.

We've built something special here, and it works because everyone contributes to keeping it valuable.

**Our Community Values:**

**1. Generosity First**

Share what you know. Help where you can. The rising tide lifts all boats.

**2. Real Over Perfect**

We value authentic experience over polished advice. Share your struggles, not just your wins.

**3. Signal > Noise**

Before posting, ask: "Does this add value?" We're optimizing for quality, not quantity.

**4. Support, Don't Sell**

Helpful recommendations are welcome. Pitches and spam are not. When in doubt, ask before promoting.

**5. Assume Good Intent**

We're all learning. Be kind, be patient, be constructive.

**What This Means:**

- Ask questions freely - there are no "dumb" questions here
- Share your knowledge generously
- Engage with others' posts - a comment can make someone's day
- Report anything that feels off - we take this seriously

That's it. No 47-page rulebook. Just mutual respect and genuine value.

Ready to contribute? We'd love to hear from you.

Hey [First Name],

You've been in [Community Name] for almost a week now. I wanted to check in with a question:

1. There's probably someone in the community who's solved exactly that problem
2. Your question will help others facing the same challenge
3. It's a great conversation starter

Drop your answer in the [Questions/Challenges Section] - I'll personally make sure you get some solid input.

Some recent questions members have asked:

- "[Example question 1]"
- "[Example question 2]"
- "[Example question 3]"

No question is too basic or too complex. That's what we're here for.

Looking forward to seeing what you're working on.
