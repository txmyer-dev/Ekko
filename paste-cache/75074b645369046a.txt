# Part 1: What is PAI?

## Overview

PAI is a **Personal AI Infrastructure** that transforms Claude Code from a generic AI assistant into a personalized system that knows your goals, remembers your preferences, learns from your feedback, and improves over time.

### Think of it like this:

- **Claude Code alone** = A powerful car engine
- **PAI** = Everything else that makes it YOUR car (steering wheel, dashboard, memory of your favorite routes, custom settings)

### The Three Levels of AI Systems:

1. **Chatbots** (ChatGPT, Claude): Ask → Answer → Forget
2. **Agentic Platforms** (Claude Code, Cursor): Ask → Use tools → Get result
3. **PAI**: Observe → Think → Plan → Execute → Verify → Learn → Improve

## Key Takeaways from Daniel Miessler's Videos

### Core Philosophy

PAI exists to solve a fundamental problem: most people don't believe they can make valuable contributions to the world. PAI helps activate people by:

1. Helping them discover and articulate their purpose through AI
2. Making powerful AI accessible to everyone, not just the elite

### What Makes PAI Different?

**Three Core Differentiators:**

1. **Goal Orientation** - Focused on YOU and your goals, not just the technology
2. **Pursuit of Optimal Output** - Always trying to produce the exact right output for your situation
3. **Continuous Learning** - Captures feedback from every interaction to improve

### PAI Primitives (Core Architecture)

1. **TELOS** - Deep goal understanding through 10 files:
    - [MISSION.md](http://MISSION.md), [GOALS.md](http://GOALS.md), [PROJECTS.md](http://PROJECTS.md), [BELIEFS.md](http://BELIEFS.md), [MODELS.md](http://MODELS.md)
    - [STRATEGIES.md](http://STRATEGIES.md), [NARRATIVES.md](http://NARRATIVES.md), [LEARNED.md](http://LEARNED.md), [CHALLENGES.md](http://CHALLENGES.md), [IDEAS.md](http://IDEAS.md)
2. **Memory System** - Three-tier architecture (hot/warm/cold) that captures:
    - Ratings and sentiment
    - Successes and failures
    - Learning patterns
3. **Hook System** - Event-driven automation that responds to:
    - Session starts
    - Tool usage
    - Task completions
    - Security validations
4. **Skill System** - Modular capabilities following: CODE → CLI → PROMPT → SKILL
5. **User/System Separation** - Your customizations (USER/) stay separate from infrastructure (SYSTEM/)

### The 16 PAI Principles

1. **User Centricity** - Built around you, not tooling
2. **Foundational Algorithm** - Scientific method: Observe → Think → Plan → Build → Execute → Verify → Learn
3. **Clear Thinking First** - Clarify the problem before prompting
4. **Scaffolding > Model** - Architecture matters more than which AI model
5. **Deterministic Infrastructure** - Use templates and patterns
6. **Code Before Prompts** - If bash can solve it, don't use AI
7. **Spec/Test/Evals First** - Write tests before building
8. **UNIX Philosophy** - Do one thing well, make it composable
9. **ENG/SRE Principles** - Treat it like production software
10. **CLI as Interface** - Command-line is faster and more reliable
11. **Goal → Code → CLI → Prompts → Agents** - Decision hierarchy
12. **Skill Management** - Modular, intelligent routing
13. **Memory System** - Capture everything worth knowing
14. **Agent Personalities** - Different approaches for different work
15. **Science as Meta-Loop** - Hypothesis → Experiment → Measure → Iterate
16. **Permission to Fail** - Can say "I don't know" to prevent hallucinations

# Part 2: VPS Setup and Installation

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your VPS has:

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04+ or similar Linux distribution
- **RAM**: At least 2GB (4GB+ recommended)
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ (for Bun runtime)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- **Claude Code**: Installed and configured

## Step 1: Prepare Your VPS

```bash
# SSH into your VPS
ssh user@your-vps-ip

# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install required dependencies
sudo apt install -y git curl build-essential

# Install Node.js (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Verify installations
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

## Step 2: Install Bun Runtime

PAI uses Bun for TypeScript execution:

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Add Bun to PATH (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify Bun installation
bun --version
```

## Step 3: Install Claude Code on VPS

```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude-code --version

# Initialize Claude Code (you'll need your Anthropic API key)
claude-code init
```

You'll be prompted to enter your Anthropic API key. Get one from: https://console.anthropic.com/

## Step 4: Choose Your Installation Path

PAI offers 3 installation options:

### **Option 1: Full Release Install (RECOMMENDED)**

Best for: Getting started quickly with everything pre-configured

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI.git
cd PAI/Releases/v2.4

# Backup existing Claude Code config (if any)
[ -d ~/.claude ] && mv ~/.claude ~/.claude-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Copy the complete PAI installation
cp -r .claude ~/

# Run the configuration wizard
cd ~/.claude
bun run PAIInstallWizard.ts
```

The wizard will ask you for:

- Your name
- Your DA (Digital Assistant) name
- Your timezone
- Voice preferences (optional)

After completion, **restart Claude Code** to activate all hooks.

### **Option 2: Bundle + Manual Packs (CUSTOMIZABLE)**

Best for: Learning the system as you build it

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI.git
cd PAI/Bundles/Official

# Run the bundle wizard (creates skeleton structure)
bun run install.ts
```

After the wizard, you MUST install packs in this order:

```bash
# Start Claude Code and give it these commands:

# 1. Install hook system
"Install the pack at PAI/Packs/pai-hook-system/"

# 2. Install core system
"Install the pack at PAI/Packs/pai-core-install/"

# 3. Install status line
"Install the pack at PAI/Packs/pai-statusline/"

# 4. Install any additional skill packs you want
"Install the pack at PAI/Packs/pai-research-skill/"
"Install the pack at PAI/Packs/pai-algorithm-skill/"
```

### **Option 3: Individual Packs (CHERRY-PICK)**

Best for: Only installing specific capabilities you need

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI.git

# Browse available packs
ls PAI/Packs/

# Give individual pack paths to Claude Code for installation
```

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create or edit your environment file:

```bash
cd ~/.claude
nano .env
```

Add your API keys and configuration:

```bash
# Anthropic API Key (required)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# ElevenLabs (optional - for voice system)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id_here

# Notification services (optional)
NTFY_TOPIC=your_ntfy_topic
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook

# User settings
USER_NAME="Your Name"
DA_NAME="Your DA Name"
TIMEZONE="America/New_York"
```

Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)

## Step 6: Set Up Your TELOS Files

TELOS is how PAI understands your goals and identity:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/USER/TELOS

# Edit each file to define yourself:
nano MISSION.md      # Your life mission
nano GOALS.md        # Current goals
nano PROJECTS.md     # Active projects
nano BELIEFS.md      # Core beliefs
nano MODELS.md       # Mental models you use
nano STRATEGIES.md   # Your strategies
nano NARRATIVES.md   # Stories you tell yourself
nano LEARNED.md      # What you've learned
nano CHALLENGES.md   # Current challenges
nano IDEAS.md        # Ideas you want to pursue
```

**Example [MISSION.md](http://MISSION.md):**

```markdown
# My Mission

To build and maintain systems that help people work more effectively with AI.

Core focus areas:
- AI infrastructure and automation
- Developer productivity
- Open source contributions
```

## Step 7: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check directory structure
ls -la ~/.claude/

# You should see:
# USER/          (your customizations)
# SYSTEM/        (PAI infrastructure)
# .env           (environment variables)
# HOOKS/         (event handlers)
# MEMORY/        (learning system)
```

Start Claude Code and test:

```bash
claude-code
```

Try these commands:

- "What are my current goals?" (should read from TELOS)
- "Rate this session as positive" (should update memory)
- "Show me my learning signals" (should display memory stats)

## Step 8: Enable Advanced Features

### Voice System (Optional)

```bash
# Sign up for ElevenLabs: https://elevenlabs.io/
# Get your API key and voice ID
# Add to .env file as shown in Step 5
```

### Notification System (Optional)

```bash
# For ntfy (mobile notifications)
# Visit: https://ntfy.sh/
# Choose a topic name and add to .env

# For Discord
# Create a webhook in your Discord server
# Add webhook URL to .env
```

### Observability Dashboard (Optional)

```bash
# Install the observability pack
cd ~/.claude
claude-code

# Then in Claude Code:
"Install the pack at PAI/Packs/pai-observability-server/"

# Start the dashboard
cd ~/.claude/SYSTEM/OBSERVABILITY
bun run server.ts

# Access at: http://your-vps-ip:3000
```

## Step 9: Configure Security

PAI includes security validation by default:

```bash
# Review security configuration
nano ~/.claude/SYSTEM/SECURITY/AllowList.json

# Add trusted commands and paths
# Example:
{
  "allowedCommands": [
    "git",
    "npm",
    "node",
    "bun"
  ],
  "allowedPaths": [
    "/home/user/projects",
    "/tmp"
  ]
}
```

## Step 10: Install Skill Packs

Browse available skills and install what you need:

**Infrastructure Packs:**

- `pai-hook-system` - Event automation (required)
- `pai-core-install` - Core functionality (required)
- `pai-statusline` - Terminal status display
- `pai-voice-system` - Voice notifications
- `pai-observability-server` - Monitoring dashboard

**Skill Packs:**

# Part 3: Usage and Maintenance

## Daily Usage Tips

### Starting a Session

```bash
# Claude Code automatically loads your context
claude-code

# Your DA will greet you and load your TELOS
```

### Rating Interactions

After any task, rate it to help PAI learn:

- "Rate this as positive"
- "Rate this as negative"
- "This was excellent work"
- "This didn't meet expectations"

### Checking Memory

```bash
# View learning signals
"Show me my learning patterns"

# View recent history
"What have I been working on?"

# Check success rate
"Show me my task success metrics"
```

### Using Skills

```bash
# Trigger research skill
"Research the latest developments in AI infrastructure"

# Use algorithm skill
"Help me solve this problem using the algorithm skill"

# Browser automation
"Navigate to example.com and extract the main content"
```

## Troubleshooting

### PAI Not Loading

```bash
# Check if Claude Code is finding the config
ls ~/.claude/

# Verify hooks are installed
ls ~/.claude/HOOKS/

# Restart Claude Code
pkill claude-code
claude-code
```

### Environment Variables Not Working

```bash
# Check .env file exists and has correct format
cat ~/.claude/.env

# Verify no syntax errors
# No spaces around =
# Correct: API_KEY=value
# Wrong: API_KEY = value
```

### Permissions Issues

```bash
# Ensure proper ownership
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.claude

# Fix permissions
chmod -R 755 ~/.claude
```

### Memory Not Updating

```bash
# Check memory directory exists
ls ~/.claude/MEMORY/

# Verify write permissions
touch ~/.claude/MEMORY/test.txt
rm ~/.claude/MEMORY/test.txt
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates

```bash
# Update PAI repository
cd PAI
git pull origin main

# Review release notes
cat CHANGELOG.md

# Apply updates (full release method)
cd Releases/v2.4
cp -r .claude ~/.claude-new
# Review differences and merge
```

### Backup Your Configuration

```bash
# Create backup
tar -czf pai-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/.claude/

# Store securely
mv pai-backup-*.tar.gz ~/backups/
```

### Monitor Performance

```bash
# Check memory usage
ls -lh ~/.claude/MEMORY/

# Review learning signals
cat ~/.claude/MEMORY/signals.json

# Check hook execution logs
tail -f ~/.claude/LOGS/hooks.log
```

## Advanced Customization

### Creating Custom Skills

```bash
# Use the createskill skill
"Create a new skill called my-custom-skill that does X"

# PAI will generate the skill structure
# Edit the generated files to customize
```

### Custom Hooks

```bash
# Add your own hook handlers
nano ~/.claude/USER/HOOKS/my_custom_hook.ts

# Example hook structure:
export async function onTaskComplete(context) {
  // Your custom logic here
  console.log("Task completed:", context.task);
}
```

### Custom Agents

```bash
# Define new agent personalities
nano ~/.claude/USER/AGENTS/my_agent.md

# Example agent:
# Name: Researcher
# Personality: Thorough and detail-oriented
# Focus: Deep analysis and verification
```
