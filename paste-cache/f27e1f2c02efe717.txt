**Session Date:** 2026-02-08
**Topic:** Premium Skool Community Design ($150/month tier)
**Thinking Tools Used:** FirstPrinciples, Council (5-agent debate)
**Context:** Redesigning AI education business for part-time execution (10-20 hrs/week) using Skool platform with freemium model

---

## 🔨 BUILD PHASE

### Step 1: Competitive Landscape Research

**Skool Platform Economics:**

- **Pricing:** $99/month for Pro plan (necessary for AutoDM, 2.9% payment processing vs 10% on Hobby)
- **Features:** Community feed, courses, gamification, events, leaderboards, native video hosting
- **Limitations:** No built-in AI tools, not full LMS (no quizzes/assignments/certificates natively)
- **Best for:** Community + courses together, cohort programs, skill-based learning

**Existing AI Communities on Skool:**

- Most communities: $0-50/month range
- Common patterns:
    - "ChatGPT Users" - free community
    - "AI Enthusiasts" - casual learning, free
    - "LABS" - claims $10K/month with AI, free tools/templates
    - "Evoluted University" - streamline operations with AI
- **Market gaps identified:**
    - Broad "AI enthusiasts" communities, not profession-specific
    - Lack structured learning paths
    - Low engagement (passive consumption)
    - No clear outcomes or certifications
    - Focus on tools (ChatGPT) rather than workflows/implementation

---

### Step 2: FirstPrinciples Analysis - "What is $150/month Actually Buying?"

### Deconstruction

**The Actual Transformation (Not Content):**

1. **Time compression** - "I don't know AI" → "I shipped 3 AI workflows this week" in weeks not months
2. **Anxiety reduction** - Economic security knowing they won't be replaced by AI users
3. **Income protection/growth** - Staying employable OR increasing productivity for raises/promotions
4. **Status signal** - Being "the AI person" in their company/network
5. **Confidence** - Removing impostor syndrome around AI tools

**The Delivery Mechanisms:**

- Accountability (someone notices if you disappear)
- Implementation support (get unstuck in hours not days)
- Curated path (don't waste time on wrong tools)
- Social proof (see peers succeeding)
- Feedback loops (submit work, get feedback, improve faster)

**The Underlying Resources:**

- Tony's time: Live teaching, Q&A, feedback (most expensive)
- Curated content: Workflow templates, courses, guides
- Community infrastructure: Skool platform, moderation
- Tools/software: Subscriptions, automation platforms
- Support labor: Response time, troubleshooting

### Constraint Classification

| Constraint | Type | Evidence | Challenge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Must charge $150 to be premium" | **Assumption** | Price for positioning, not cost-driven | Test $97, $127, $197 |
| "Monthly recurring required" | **Soft** | Choice for revenue | Could do annual prepay |
| "Tony must deliver live content" | **Assumption** | Could use recorded + guests + Eko | Minimum viable Tony? |
| "Members need continuous new content" | **Assumption** | Maybe need support on existing | Depth > breadth |
| "Platform must be Skool" | **Soft** | Tony's choice for convenience | Smart choice given network effects |
| "Free tier must exist" | **Soft** | Business model choice | Freemium is better strategy |

### Reconstruction: What Does $150/Month Actually Buy?

**The actual product isn't "access to a community."**

**It's "guaranteed AI capability improvement month over month."**

Someone paying $150/month is buying:

1. **Speed**: "I will be AI-competent in 90 days, not 12 months fumbling alone"
2. **De-risking**: "I won't waste time on wrong tools - expert curated path"
3. **Accountability**: "I will actually do the work because deadlines + peers + coach"
4. **Implementation insurance**: "When I get stuck, I get unstuck in <24 hours"
5. **Ongoing relevance**: "As AI changes, I stay current without research overhead"

**Key Insight:**

The limiting assumption: Thinking we're selling "membership to a community" when we're actually selling **"ongoing AI capability insurance with implementation support."**

$150/month tier is justified if it delivers:

- Faster time-to-competency (3 months vs 12 months self-taught)
- Guaranteed unstuck (24-hour response on implementation questions)
- Curated efficiency (Tony tests tools/workflows, members skip trial-and-error)
- Accountability infrastructure (weekly check-ins, project deadlines, peer review)
- Continuous updates (new workflows added monthly as AI landscape changes)

This is **dramatically different from:**

- "$50/month: Here's a Discord and some videos"
- "Free: Here's some templates, good luck"

**The $150 tier can't just be "more stuff" - it must be "measurably better outcomes through support + accountability + expertise access."**

---

### Step 3: Council Debate - Freemium Architecture

**Council Members:** Product Designer (Aditi), Pricing Strategist (Serena), Community Architect (Marcus), Customer Success (Dev), Growth Marketer (Ava)

**Round 1: Initial Positions**

**Aditi (Product Designer - Freemium Expert):**
Free tier should include all foundational AI education - tutorials, prompt libraries, community discussion, weekly group calls. Make it genuinely excellent. People should learn real skills here.

Premium at $150/month must deliver: Direct access to Tony - hot-seat coaching, personalized workflow audits, implementation accountability. Plus private cohort of serious builders.

**The conversion psychology:** Free users eventually hit a wall where generic knowledge isn't enough. They need someone to look at *their* specific situation. That moment - "I know what to do but I can't figure out why it's not working for me" - is the natural upgrade trigger.

**Critical rule:** Free must never feel like a teaser. It must feel like a complete product. Premium is a different product entirely - it's acceleration, not access.

**Serena (Pricing Strategist):**
The $150 price point is not a premium - it's a filter. At $50, you attract hobbyists who churn in 60 days. At $150, you attract professionals who treat this as business investment and stay 12+ months.

What justifies 3x over competitors:

- Live implementation sessions (2x/month, 90min) where Tony builds real AI workflows on screen
- Private prompt library that evolves monthly - living asset, not static course
- Peer accountability pods of 5-7 members with structured weekly check-ins
- "Office hours" async thread - 48-hour guaranteed response from Tony personally

Price anchoring: position against $500/month masterminds and $2,000 courses, not against $50 communities.

**Marcus (Community Architect):**
Free tier should be the best AI education community on the internet, full stop. Structured curriculum, weekly challenges, active discussion, resource library that makes people feel guilty they're not paying.

Premium is about proximity and acceleration. Live implementation with Tony, private cohort of serious builders, accountability pods, direct feedback on projects.

**Coexistence:** Free members see premium members shipping real results publicly. That visibility is your conversion mechanism. Premium members get builder identity. Free members get aspiration.

**Dev (Customer Success):**
Free tier: community-powered support, peer Q&A, searchable knowledge base, weekly group office hours (60min open mic). Response time is community-dependent, no SLA.

Premium at $150/month delivers *implementation accountability*:

- 48-hour guaranteed response from Tony on implementation questions
- Monthly small-group sessions (max 8 people, 45min) - screen-share actual workflows, get live feedback
- Structured 90-day implementation tracks with milestone check-ins
- Peer accountability pods (groups of 4) that Tony seeds but members run

**Success metric:** 80% of premium members ship a working AI workflow within 90 days. That's the $150 justification - measurable transformation, not content consumption.

**Ava (Growth Marketer):**
Free tier strategy: Make it the viral engine. Weekly AI tool breakdowns, prompt template library, community challenge board where members share wins. This gets screenshotted and shared on LinkedIn/Twitter organically.

**Conversion triggers:** Free tier creates specific gap. Members see what AI can do but hit ceiling on implementation in their actual workflow. Premium bridges that gap.

**Key metrics:** 3-5% monthly free-to-premium conversion. With 2,000 free members = 60-100 premium at $150 = $9-15K MRR.

**Retention mechanic:** Premium cohorts run in 90-day cycles. Members who complete get alumni status with reduced rates.

**Council Synthesis - Complete Convergence:**

✅ **Free tier must be genuinely excellent** - Complete product, not crippled teaser
✅ **Premium sells proximity + acceleration** - Not "more content" but direct Tony access
✅ **$150 is professional filter** - Serious practitioners who stay 12+ months
✅ **Conversion trigger is implementation gaps** - Generic knowledge isn't enough for specific situation
✅ **Tony's time leveraged through structure** - Accountability pods, cohort cycles (6-8 hrs/week)
✅ **Measurable outcomes justify price** - 80% ship working AI workflow within 90 days

| **Success Metric** | # of members (vanity) | 80% ship workflows (outcomes) |
