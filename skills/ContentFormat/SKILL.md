description: Platform-native content formatting and clipboard copy. USE WHEN user says 'format for LinkedIn', 'format for X', 'format for Twitter', 'format for email', 'format for Slack', 'format for Notion', 'copy to clipboard', 'platform format', 'make this ready for [platform]', OR when user wants to copy output in a platform-specific format. This is a FORMATTING tool — it reformats existing content, not a content creator.

# ContentFormat Skill

Reformat existing content for a specific platform's native format, then copy to clipboard. Eliminates formatting loss when pasting across platforms.

## Why This Exists

AI output is typically markdown. But LinkedIn uses emoji bullets and line breaks, X/Twitter has a 280-char limit, Slack uses its own markup, and email needs clean plaintext or HTML. Copying markdown to these platforms produces broken formatting. This skill converts content to the target platform's native format and copies it to the clipboard ready to paste.

**This is a FORMATTING tool, not a content creator.** It takes existing content and reformats it. For content creation, use other skills.
