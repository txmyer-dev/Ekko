# Fabric Pattern Reference Guide

## What Are Fabric Patterns?

Fabric patterns are single-purpose AI workflows. Each pattern does one thing well — extracting wisdom from a transcript, analyzing a sales call, generating a product brief, improving your writing. Think of them as power tools: each shaped for a specific job.

Your PAI system ships with 259 patterns available as slash commands inside Claude Code.

## How to Use

**In Claude Code** — type the pattern name as a slash command:
```
/extract-wisdom
/summarize-meeting
/analyze-risk
```

**Pipe content in** — paste or pipe any text (article, transcript, meeting notes, code) and the pattern processes it automatically.

**With a file** — reference a file path and the pattern reads it:
```
/analyze-paper path/to/paper.pdf
```

Each pattern outputs clean, structured results. No prompting required.
