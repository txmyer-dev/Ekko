# Client Telos Template — Session Guide

> **For Tony's use during PAI Build Sessions.** Copy this entire directory into the client's `~/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/TELOS/` at the start of Hour 1.

---

## How to Use

1. **Before the session:** Copy this directory into the client's PAI installation
2. **During Hour 1:** Walk through the 6 core files together, asking the guided questions and typing their answers live
3. **Flow:** TELOS.md (5 min) → MISSION.md (15 min) → GOALS.md (15 min) → PROJECTS.md (10 min) → PROBLEMS.md (10 min) → STRATEGIES.md (5 min)
4. **After the session:** The 12 seeded files evolve naturally through the Telos Update workflow

## Tips

- Start with MISSION — it's the most personal and sets the tone for everything else
- Don't try to perfect anything — these are living documents
- The client's energy will be highest in the first 20 minutes — use it on MISSION and GOALS
- Read the questions aloud and type as they talk — don't hand them a form
- If they get stuck on a question, skip it and come back — forward momentum matters more than completeness

## Quick Copy Command

```bash
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/Telos/ClientTemplate/* ~/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/TELOS/
```
