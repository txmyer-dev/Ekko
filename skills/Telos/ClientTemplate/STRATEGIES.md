## Discovery Questions

*These are harder. Most people have strategies but haven't named them. Let's surface yours.*

**1. When you're at your best, what principles are you following (even unconsciously)?**


**2. What advice do you give others that you should follow yourself?**


**3. What's one thing you've learned the hard way that now guides your decisions?**


**4. What do you deliberately say NO to? What's your filter?**

## Your Strategies

*Name each one. A good strategy is a principle you can apply to multiple situations.*

### Strategy 1:
- **Principle:**
- **Why it works for you:**
- **When to apply it:**

### Strategy 2:
- **Principle:**
- **Why it works for you:**
- **When to apply it:**

### Strategy 3:
- **Principle:**
- **Why it works for you:**
- **When to apply it:**

*These evolve. Your agent will reference them when making decisions on your behalf — so make them honest, not aspirational.*
