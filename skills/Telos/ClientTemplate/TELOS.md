# TELOS — Your Life Operating System

> This is the central hub for everything you're building toward. Not a productivity system — a life system.

---

## What This Is

TELOS is where you centralize what you want from **life**, not just tasks. It's what makes your AI agent different from ChatGPT — because your agent knows what you're actually trying to achieve, not just what you typed today.

Every file in this directory is a facet of your life context. Together they form the operating system your agent uses to make better decisions on your behalf.
