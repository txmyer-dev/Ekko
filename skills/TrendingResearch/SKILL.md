description: Trending topic discovery and momentum analysis. USE WHEN user says 'what's trending', 'trending topics', 'what's hot', 'viral right now', 'emerging trends', 'trend report', 'what's happening in [domain]', OR when user wants a pulse check on current trends across tech, security, business, or culture. This is a DISCOVERY tool — it finds what's trending, not a deep research tool.

# TrendingResearch Skill

Discover what's trending right now across multiple domains. Returns a structured trend report with momentum signals, source URLs, and category breakdowns.

## Why This Exists

Staying current requires scanning multiple sources across domains. This skill runs parallel WebSearch queries with recency emphasis to surface what's trending in tech, security, business, and culture — then structures the results into an actionable trend report. Unlike the Research skill (which answers specific questions), this discovers what questions you should be asking.

**This is a DISCOVERY tool, not a deep research tool.** It finds emerging trends and momentum signals. For deep dives on specific topics, use the Research skill.
